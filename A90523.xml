            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He then ſaid, he could not beleeve that the Canon was ſo expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; therfore ſent for the booke of Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but being therby further convinced, &amp; not knowing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he paſſionatly wiſhed, that either it had beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe expreſſed, or that noe explanation had beene added to the Canon. In fine he ingenuouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his former neglect to ſtudy theſe controverſies, having hitherto eſteemed lightly of them; yet ſith oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſeemed to require, he now reſolved to apply his ſtudies a while this way. Heerupon he was pleaſed to undertake our diſmiſſion from the H. C. C. till he ſhould firſt have aſſayed to winne us to conformity in a ſcholaſticall way, ſith he diſcerned in us (as he ſaid) ſome ſchollerſhip above his expectation. At the ſame time he ordered us, ſeverally to ſet downe in writing within the ſpace of the moneth following (&amp; then to bring to him) 3<note n="*" place="margin">The B. would not diſpute at all about the greateſt grieva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, viz. intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſcription unto <hi>5</hi> books in ſeverall points queſtionable and faulty.</note> arguments, againſt the Croſſe in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,

For ſome of us ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were againe ſummoned by letters miſſive, to the H. C. Court, &amp; then dealt with in a vexatious ſort. I was compelled to travell 30 miles from my dwelling, three ſeverall times in 14 daies. On one of theſe Court daies M. Nichols of b. m. a moſt pious and learned Miniſter, being required to give an accompt of his arguments he had delivered to the B. was in open Court by the B. &amp; D. Snell ſcornfully taunted &amp; giered, as if what he had written was raw, and ſhould therfore be roſted, when they were not able to gainſay the wiſedome &amp; Spirit, by which he ſpake. At the ſame time (I having beene immediately before ſharply ſpoken unto by the B. and Commiſſioners, &amp; deferred to the Court for the weeke following) one of the B<hi rend="sup">s</hi> cheife<note n="*" place="margin">Prelates have gentlemen to wait on them, but they are ſuch for the moſt part, as are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly debauched, as is commonly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> Gentlemen, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two Popiſh Gentlemen, belonging to a great Earle then in Cheſter, plucked me a litle aſide, &amp; did idly &amp; diſdainfully upbraid me of ſimplicity, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch me as if I were conjuring, becauſe I looked to the ground, &amp; anſwered nothing; they therfore alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded I ſhould goe to Hell, ſith my looks ſeemed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward. Such their vile language uttered likewiſe with blaſphemours ſwearing &amp; curſing, in the hearing of many thronging about us, occaſioned a Gentleman that was preſent to complaine of their uncivill behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, &amp; in humane cariage: whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they being much inraged, thruſt him on the ſuddaine to the doore of the palace, and caſt him headlong dovvne the ſtaires, to the endangering of his life. When the Court was riſen the B. was privatly informed of his mans inſolencies, who ſeemed to be ſomwhat diſcontented towards him; yet
<pb facs="tcp:112189:6"/>ſayd, that vvhat his ſervant had diſorderly done could be noe diſparagment to him, that was his maſter. At my comming to Cheſter the weeke follovving, as I had beene ordered, the B. vvas not vvell in the morning of the Court-day, &amp; in that reſpect kept his chamber, yet having notice of my attending, ſent for me, &amp; lying on his bed reaſoned &amp; expoſtulated with me touching the Ceremonies a full houre, letting fall by the way ſome complaints, that his remiſſe courſe with us, had beene prejudiciall to his preferment to Lincolne Biſhoprick, vacant about that time. Soe that in great paſſion he threatned to ſuſpend, excommunicate, degrade, and make the land too hot for me; aſking me what I would doe. I anſvvered in the words of the Prophet,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7.</note> I will looke unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: my God will heare me. He retorted, God would not heare a blaſphemer, a blaſphemer of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of England, &amp; that deſpiſed her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. I anſvvered againe, that I deſired to feare God, &amp; abhorred blaſphemy; &amp; that a refuſall of conformity to ſuperſtitious ceremonies, eſteemed by the Prelaticall party to be things indifferent, was neither blaſphemy nor contempt. In concluſion he vvas pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe me at that time vvithout any cenſure, ſave of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large fees to officers of the Court, tovvards payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvherof he gave ten ſhillings. Not long after this the ſaid Prelate printed a booke in defenſe of the 3 no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies, pretending to anſvver our argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts given in againſt them,<note n="*" place="margin">Abridgm. was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the B. by M.

The ſone after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation became a Phyſitian, &amp; was proſecuted for not kneeling at Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> &amp; alſo that unanſvverable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the reaſons of the Miniſters of Lincolne Dioceſſe, ſo farre as it argued againſt them. But the vveaknes of his Defenſe and pretended anſvver is fully &amp; effectually diſcovered by the learned D. Ames in his
<pb facs="tcp:112189:6"/>printed Reply therto: And in his Freſh Suit againſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ceremonies in Gods vvorſhip, or Triplication to D. Burgeſſe his Rejoynder for D. Morton.</p>
            <p>The tranſlation of the ſaid Prelate to Lichfeild neere the ſame time, became occaſion to D. Bridgman, the Parſon of Wiggan in Lancaſhire, to ſucceed in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of Cheſter; vvho for a ſpace moved not much againſt any, purſuing rather his vvorldly affaires, ſave only that he ſuſpended a fevv Non-conformiſts, and<note n="*" place="margin">At Knuteſford a market towne in Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire a Gentleman of the countrey being vainly diſpoſed, did cauſe a beare paſſing through the ſtreet to be led into the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: which the Biſhop hearing of ſuſpended the Chappell from having any divine ſervice or ſermons for a long time, as being profaned by the beare.</note> Knuteſford Chappel. But vvhen D. Neale the Prelate of Wincheſter, could not reſiſt the title of Grace, but vvas removed to York, &amp; ſhould viſit in Cheſter Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, being in that Province; then the ſaid Prelate of Cheſter, pretending feare of the Archb. of Y. in caſe that at his Viſitation he ſhould finde any Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, &amp; ſoe taxe him of negligence or partiality, did therfore ſend for &amp; inhibit privatly moſt of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts in his Dioceſſe. About the ſame time, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notice given, I went to him at his houſe in Lancaſhire, &amp; deſired his favorable conuivency as formerly; which he denied to grant, leſt (as he ſaid) he ſhould hazard the favour of his Prince. Yet he required to heare at that time what I could ſay againſt kneeling at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. I alledged our Saviour Chriſt his argument againſt it. For<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.7.</note> he eſteemeth it a vaine worſhipping of him, when mens precepts are taught for doctrines; which by a juſt inference I applyed againſt kneeling at the Sacrament. Now all the anſvver the B. gave was that he expected from me a more learned argument. And then ſaid, He thought I would have inſiſted in the geſture uſed by Chriſt at the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he would ſhew me what manner of geſture that was, to convince therby how unſeemly the uſe of it would be in the
<pb facs="tcp:112189:7"/>Church. And ſo he gravely laid himſelfe along on a bench by a table in his parlour, leaning on his elbow: &amp; then affirmed Chriſts poſture all the Supper was ſuch; which he ſaid, I was not able to contradict, eſpecially if I underſtood Greek, ſith the originall word uſed in the Goſpells, implied ſoe much. I replied, that what ever my underſtanding in the Greek tongue was, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Tranſlaters of the new Teſtament were ſkilful therin, &amp; had rendred it<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>About two yeers after (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 'twas thought the ſtorme of the Archb.

            <p>THere are two ſtaves wherewith the Lord Chriſt, the great Shepherd of his ſheep, doth uſually feed his flock; Doctrine and Diſcipline. By the one he maketh them to lie downe in greene paſtures, and leadeth them beſide the ſtill waters, repleniſhing their ſoules with the food of life; by the other he guideth them and ordereth them in their going out and comming in, for their further peace and ſafety: and both his rodde and his ſtaffe doe comfort them. If either of theſe be wanting, the flock is endangered; &amp; if God in his juſt judgement cauſe one of them to faile, the other preſently comes to be in jeopardy. Wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught, that where the reignes of Diſcipline are ſlackned or ill guided, there the ſoundnes of Doctrine doth hardly ſubſiſt long: and where the trueth of Doctrine is aſſaulted, there the courſe of Diſcipline is not free from injurious attempts. Though Doctrine juſtly challenge the firſt place, yet ſeeing Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline alſo, to ſpeak properly, is a part of Doctrine, being onely the practiſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine trueth revealed concerning the guidance of the Church; hence it may not without cauſe ſhare in the arguments alledged for the neceſſity and benefit of the other. They both being ſo neerly allyed, and joyntly requiſite to the welfare of Gods Church, the Enemy, ever envying the proſperity, and plotting the ruine thereof, where he cannot prevayle againſt the one, he ſets on work his miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous devices againſt the other: When he cannot hinder the growth of good corne and ſound trueths, by ſowing tares; then he makes ſo much the more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious onſets upon the fences and hedges of due order and government. And if his deſignes may be effected in the one, he findes a readyer way to the other. But he that hath bruiſed Satans head, is not ignorant of his devices, nor ſlow to reſiſt him in his enterpriſes. Chriſt doth graciouſly provide for the ſafety of his flock, againſt both kindes of evills, by ſuch inſtruments as he is wont to rayſe for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and vindicating the trueth of thoſe lawes which he hath given, both to direct and maintaine his people in the obedience of his will, and to ſtop the mouth of all iniquity oppugning the ſame. His goodnes therefore is to be acknowledged in whatſoever helps to this purpoſe are affoorded unto us. And that thou mayeſt the better be provoked hereunto, Chriſtian Reader, concerning the Treatiſe now preſented unto thee, take a brief ſurvey at thy firſt entrance, of ſomewhat may further fit thee unto a more judicious and profitable peruſall of the work it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The maine errours touching the exerciſe of Church-government, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto theſe two extremes, whereby men ſwarve from that middle and ſafe way preſcribed by Chriſt, the onely Prince and Lawgiver of his Church. Some ambitious of preeminence, making themſelves lords over Gods heritage, have brought in, and ſeek to maintaine a Tyrannicall kinde of government in the Church, by ingroſſing all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction into their owne hands, as the Popes, and Popiſh Biſhops: Againſt theſe Vſurpers many Worthies have ſtood up, and done valiantly, in their Writings, whereof divers remaine yet unanſwered. Others have erroneouſly fallen into a contrary extreme; while oppoſing Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall Tyranny, they have become pleaders for a meere Democracy; and not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to reject Provinciall &amp; Dioceſan Biſhops, they have impugned the lawfull
<pb facs="tcp:112189:14"/>combination of Churches in Provinciall and Claſſicall Synods. Againſt this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold errour the enſuing Treatiſe is directed. The former part thereof was written long agone, about the yeare 1618, upon the occaſion noted in the Introduction. And though it was but a beginning of a larger writing, neither finiſhed nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for publick view: yet conſidering how little there is extant in this kinde, how uſefull it may be for theſe times, and what affinity it hath with the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy touching Claſſes and Synods, by how much the oppoſers of ſuch joynt Preſbyteries doe ſeldome allow the due power of particular Elderſhips; I thought good to prefixe it before the other, in ſuch wiſe as it doth now come foorth. The ſecond and maine part of this Treatiſe diſcuſſeth at large (and more fully then any other yet ſeene) the queſtion concerning the due power of Claſſicall &amp; Synodall Aſſemblies. A controverſy, in a manner unknowne to former ages, and for the preſent ſcarcely heard of among the Reformed Churches in other nations. For though the poſitive trueth thereof be manifeſt from the teſtimonies of Orthodox Writers of all times and places; yet hitherto it hath not beene ſhewed that ever any Authours of note (I meane either of former ages, or other nations) have maintained the aſſertions here oppoſed, viz. that the power of Claſſes &amp; Synods is an undue power, and that all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction muſt be confined within the bounds of a particular Congregation. <hi>H. Barrow,</hi> &amp; thoſe of that Sect, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the firſt that in ſuch ſort have oppoſed this kinde of government. The <hi>Arminians</hi> indeed have ſpoken much againſt the juriſdiction &amp; deciding ſentence of Synods,<note n="*" place="margin">Cenſur. Confeſ. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtr. p. 322.326.328. Apol. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtr. f. 6. &amp; 282-290.</note> but upon other grounds; to wit, ſo farre as it taketh away that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Prophecy which they plead for, and deſcribe to be in effect an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted licentiouſnes of venting and maintaining almoſt any thing in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They doe ſo contradict the power of Synods, that withall they overthrow all Eccleſiaſticall judgment and cenſure (at leaſt in matters of hereſie &amp; falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine) as well in a particular Congregation as elſwhere. Herein they differ from the Patrons of Independencie, here diſputed againſt. Theſe therefore, though they be not all Browniſts, yet they muſt not take it ill to ſee this errour in the following Treatiſe ſometimes branded with the mark of <hi>Browniſme.</hi> eſpecially when the Authour deales with Mr <hi>Canne,</hi> a knowne Separatiſt, and hitherto the buſieſt Diſputer for this opinion. Beſides, it is not unknowne that this Tenet of Independe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy hath been attended with Semiſeparatiſme in divers of the better ſort of thoſe that have held it, both in Mr <hi>Iacobs</hi> time, when Orthodox men began firſt to be ſtained with it; &amp; of later yeares alſo, when new exorbitant oppreſſions of the Hierarchy, have occaſioned many to witneſſe their diſlike of Prelaticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereof ſome eſchewing that rock of uſurping Epiſcopacy, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately ruſhed upon theſe ſands of Popularity and Independency. And theſe are the points here diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Authour of this Defence, not to ſpeak of his other abilities wherewith he was excellently furniſhed unto every good work in the Miniſtery whereunto he was called, it may be obſerved how he was ſpecially fitted unto the maintaining of trueths of this nature. He was not as one of yeſterday in regard of his knowledge, ſtudy &amp; practiſe of theſe points of Church-government. Long experience hath taught him in theſe things what he ſayth, and whereof he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.
<pb facs="tcp:112189:14"/>Of thoſe fourty yeares &amp; upward, wherein he laboured in the Miniſtery, for thirty of them &amp; above, he hath beene converſant in the exerciſe of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall and Claſſicall government. During which time, his abode being in the ſame place where the ancient and chiefeſt oppoſites unto this Diſcipline were ſeated, he had ſpeciall occaſion to be acquainted with their courſes, and to arme himſelf and others againſt them. Beſides, it may not be amiſſe to obſerve the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence which the Authour hath had with divers of the learnedeſt of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the eſteeme which they have had of him and his abilities in theſe points of Divine learning. I will inſtance onely in theſe three Worthies, <hi>Mr Parker, Mr Sh.</hi> the Author of the <hi>Reply to D. Down.</hi> and <hi>D. Ames;</hi> whoſe names uſe frequently to be mentioned in writings of this kinde. For <hi>Mr Parker,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and loving acquaintance betwixt him and the Authour, is partly noted<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 105.</note> in the Treatiſe itſelf. And though <hi>Mr Dav.</hi> would make his Reader to ſuſpect it were otherwiſe, yet it what he hath written<note n="*" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 74.75.76.</note> to this purpoſe be examined by the rule and ſquare of trueth; it will be found to be onely a ſiniſter inſinuation, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon unſound reports. The widow of <hi>Mr Par.</hi> hath of later yeares before ſufficient witneſſes proteſted ſolemnely the foule untrueth of that that was layd to this our Authours charge concerning him. Which charge while M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to juſtify, he ſleightly paſſeth over the maine thing where with the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> as he calles him, had cleered himſelf from that imputation, and inſtead of due anſwer, turneth aſide unto other matters, neither true nor pertinent, as may be manifeſted from undenyable evidences. After <hi>Mr Parker</hi> removed to <hi>Doeſborough,</hi> to preach to that <hi>Gariſon</hi> (not to a <hi>Leager,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. hath it;) where he died, not about 3 moneths (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. ſaith) but above 8 moneths at leaſt after he went from <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> not in the yeare 1613. (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. was informed) but in the y. 1614: from thence he wrote many loving letters to the Authour, wherein he doth thankfully acknowledge ſundry kinde offices received, &amp; occaſionally intreateth the performance of others. Among the reſt, being cauſeleſly accuſed touching ſome things in his booke <hi>de Deſcenſu ad Inferos</hi> (which he dedicated to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, together with the other Officers of the ſame Church) he writes thus, I <hi>pray, uſe the meanes which conveniently you can, to cleere my innocency, &amp;c.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in another letter; <hi>I thanke you for your paines in defending my innocency, which</hi> I <hi>would keep if I might, howſoever the ſucceſse fall out for my returne to Amſterdam, &amp;c.</hi> Touching that very matter he writes, <hi>I thanke you for the paines you have taken for me, although in vaine: at which</hi> I <hi>am not diſmayed nor any whir moved, being aſſured that it is come to paſſe by the will of the Lord, who I know will be my God as well out of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam as in it, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas the ſecond part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sh. his <hi>Reply</hi> was committed to the Authours truſt, for the overſeeing of the preſſe, and ſome paſſages were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which he conceived to be prejudiciall unto the due maintaining of the cauſe, <hi>Mr Parker</hi> being advertiſed thereof, returned this anſwer: I <hi>have gone in my</hi>

               <hi>third book, to the very poynt you doubt of, and there left, till I had ſeem this book printed.</hi> I <hi>am not as yet reſolved fully about theſe things: &amp;c. Being I am not as yet clearely reſolved. you may not look</hi> I <hi>ſhould ſend you my judgement therein, ſave onely this, that</hi> I <hi>encline to your opinion, for ought</hi> I <hi>yet ſee in the ſpecialities by you mentioned, &amp;c.</hi> Afterwards, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered further of thoſe particulars, he approved our Authors judgment,
<pb facs="tcp:112189:15"/>and ſaith in his next letter, I <hi>verily think as you write, that every Congregation, &amp;c.</hi> The matter itſelf would be too long to rehearſe in this place. He adviſed him at the ſame time to qualify the words about which the difficulty was, &amp;c. who choſe rather to ſend the Copie to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. for the amending or altering of what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be amiſſe. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. returned the Copie, with theſe words, I <hi>have correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as I might) the maine poynt of your ſcruple. As for the reſt, although ſome things might be bettered, or better ſet downe, or altered, yet (for ought I ſee) they are not ſuch as ſhould ſtay the printing, till Mr A. &amp;c.</hi> The liberty thus uſed about this book was granted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sh. himſelf, who aſſcribed ſo much unto our Authours judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe matters, that when he ſent the ſayd book to be printed, he wrote thus unto him; <hi>I pray you, peruſe and ponder it, adde, alter, or detract ad placitum. The author is no ſuch man, but can eaſily caſt himſelf doume at, yea under the feet of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. and the more you doe therein, the more he ſhalbe and will acknowledge himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to you, &amp;c.</hi> In his next letter he ſaith, <hi>I heartily intreat you to help more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, in correcting, not the faults of the workman with you, onely, but my faults alſo. Adde therefore, I pray, alter &amp; detract therein, &amp;c. what the Lord ſhall direct you, &amp;c.</hi> Shortly after he wrote againe to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>Once againe I intreat you to peruſe all well, &amp; adde, alter, or detract what you ſee good.</hi> Our Authour having noted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the <hi>Reply,</hi> as was ſayd before, which he judged to tend to the weakning of the authority of Synods, &amp; to the ſtrengthening of <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> in his oppoſition againſt them, <hi>Mr Sh.</hi> having notice thereof, anſwered as followeth, writing of himſelf in the third perſon, as ſometimes before, for better ſecurity in thoſe dangerous times: <hi>Concerning the difference betwixt the authors judgement and yours, I hope it will not begreat, upon ſecond thoughts adviſed. I am ſure his meaning is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme H. Ia. againſt whom he diſputed by writing, about the ſubject you ſpeake of. The author reſteth fully perſwaded of that he hath written, yet referreth againe (as he did before) his doings to cenſure, and that by you, Mr Ames, and Mr Parker, or either of you, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. ſoe be that the adverſarie he anſwered.</hi> Afterwards he explained himſelf more fully, on this manner. <hi>Had my beloved altered what he deemed untrue or inſufficient, he had done but what I deſired, and would have bene well pleaſed with, ſoe he that it had not weakned the anſwer. But to come to the particulars. 1. Concerning the Synods, both their inſtitution and power, what it is, belongeth to another queſtion. neither conceive I how ought from that aſſertion in the Reply (which you except againſt) can be drawne to prejudice the judgment or practiſe of the Churches governed by Synods: for I conceive not ſo of their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, that they robbe the particular Churches (whereof Elders there ſit to determine of cauſes) of the power of government by their Preſbyteries. Nay rather, ſeeing their Synods have their power, by and from the deputation which the Elders there aſſembled have from the particular Churches (if I be not deceyved) it will follow that the power of government originally reſteth in them, and not in the Synods, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve in theſe paſſages of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sh. 's letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what I intended and mentioned before. 1. His judgment (ſet downe here more plainly then in any place of his book) touching the power of Synods in the determining of cauſes, agreeable unto that which the Authour maintaineth in this Treatiſe; conſidering what he ſaith in his<note n="(a)" place="margin">Pag. 89. 90. 203.</note> anſwer to the objections alledged out of <hi>Mr Parker.</hi> 2. The difference then acknowledged betwixt <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> and other Non-conformiſts, concerning the authority of Synods, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. would
<pb facs="tcp:112189:15"/>ſeeme to excuſe<note n="(b)" place="margin">Apol. repl. p. 236.</note> by ſome words of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I. wherein he ſpeakes not directly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this poynt in controverſy. 3. The Authours care to maintaine the due power of Claſſes and Synods, even in thoſe times, when there could be no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his owne advantage, or private ingagement therein, wherewith his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites doe unjuſtly<note n="(c)" place="margin">Apol. repl. p. 61, 63, 232, 235.

Moreover, whereas the Authour hath taken the liberty upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to witneſſe his diſſent from D. <hi>Ames,</hi> touching certaine particulars in this controverſy; he hath done no more then D. A. was wont to allow unto all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Readers of his writings, and in ſpeciall unto the Authour.

            <p>To come neerer unto the work in hand; the occaſion of this writing touching Claſſes and Synods, cannot but be accounted grievous unto ſuch as have hearts to be affected with the diſſenſions of brethren. But bitter roots doe many times yeeld ſweet and wholeſome fruits. God hath here alſo many wayes ordered for good that which in itſelf was and tended to evill. I need not inlarge about that whereof they that are deſirous, may eaſily be informed from what hath been heretofore publiſhed.

Theſe being divulged, firſt in written copies, and afterwards in print, gave juſt occaſion unto as publick an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Unto this Anſwer hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a twofold <hi>Reply,</hi> the one called <hi>Apologeticall,</hi> by him that had holpen to complaine; the other entitled <hi>The Churches plea for her right,</hi> by a knowne Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, ſtanding in oppoſition to all the Reformed Churches; and in his behalfe, who refuſed to joyne as a member unto his Church, when he ſchiſmed from that whereof he was a member when the complaints were framed. Theſe Replyes undertake to handle, beſides matters of fact, theſe two poynts, that were at the ſame time oppoſed, to wit, the due power of Claſſes and Synods, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of baptiſing infants, whoſe parents are no members of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<pb facs="tcp:112189:16"/>The former of theſe is ſufficiently maintained in the enſuing Treatiſe. For the other, though the Author have not gone ſo farre in it as in this; yet he hath layd ſuch a foundation, as upon which it will not be difficult to build what may ſatiſfy for the clearing of that controverſie. Whereof more hereafter, as conveniency and publick benefit ſhall require. Touching perſonall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though I acknowledge my ſelf doubly and trebly bound to vindicate the Authors reputation, at whoſe feet I have been brought up, and from whom I have received farre more then by ſuch or better meanes I am ever able to requite; and though it were eaſy to ſhew how his oppoſites have offended in many untrueths touching matters of fact, and vaine pretences of meeknes in the midſt of great bitternes, &amp;c. yet I am reſolved to paſſe by, and to bury theſe things in ſilence, unleſſe further cauſe be given for the publiſhing of them. And hereunto as I have been adviſed by others, ſo I have the rather yeelded, conſidering (as they alſo alledged) that the benefit to be expected from dealing in theſe matters, would be but of a narrow extent, reaching onely to the ſatiſfaction of a few, and little concerning the maine cauſe; that the Authours good name and bleſſed remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is ſo deeply ingraven in the hearts of thoſe that are acquainted with his wayes and writings, that no envie nor obloquie ſhall ever be able to raſe it out. Againe, they that will but compare the <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Replyes</hi> together, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt plaine dealing and groundleſſe ſurmiſes, evidence of trueth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable inſinuations, ſhall hardly need any further help for their ſatiſfaction; ſpecially if they be mindfull of the Rule, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. from which theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites have too too frequently ſwarved; and in which reſpect M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. had juſt cauſe to intreat his Reader<note n="(f)" place="margin">Apol. repl. praef. neer the end.</note> 
               <hi>to ſuſpend his cenſure concerning what he hath ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that plauſible and colourable name of the <hi>Church,</hi> uſed by the Replyers when they ſpake of a few diſſenting from the Authour, is now further manifeſted to be inconſiſtent with thoſe paſſages whereunto in ſuch ſort it was applyed; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they that then complained, doe now quietly enjoy themſelves and communion with the Church, in the continued obſervation of the ſame orders that were practiſed before: except onely W. B. the foreman of the Complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, now a profeſſed Arminian. And of thoſe that once joyned with him, ſome before, others ſince the Authours death have plainly ſignifyed their better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects unto him, and given free and full teſtimony of his well deſervings, even of that Church, both for Doctrine and Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>To returne unto his Defence, here publiſhed, the greater part of it is in way of anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. who hath been the forwardeſt and largeſt in this part of the plea touching Claſſes and Synods. It ſeemes alſo that he hath not been a little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his paines about this work, by the reiterated editions and ſundry ſhapes into which this his writing touching Independent government hath been caſt. The<note n="(g)" place="margin">Printed in the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re 1635.</note> firſt edition, which the Authour here deales with, was ſeconded with another, into which he hath taken onely that which concernes this controverſie, adorning it with this new and faire title,<note n="(h)" place="margin">In the y. 1641.</note>

               <hi>Aſſertion of the Government of the Church of Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> thereunto annexed. Thus the ſame writing hath met with ſeverall Refutations, whereof though this be the laſt in birth, yet it was the firſt in conception. And here the Authour, as he tooke more time, ſo he hath more cloſely followed his oppoſite; &amp; being better acquainted with his condition and courſes, hath more neerly applyed his anſwers unto him, for further conviction. However,<note n="*" place="margin">Auguſt. de Trin. l. 1. c. 3.</note> it may be profitable to behold ſeverall learned men, avouching and pleading for the ſame trueth: and many blowes may beat downe an errour, that could not be felld at once. But it may ſeeme ſtrange that <hi>Mr Cannes</hi> writings, being ſuch as the ſeverall Refuters have obſerved them to be, ſhould yet have the honour of three ſeverall Refutations.<note place="margin">See afterw. p. 145, 146. &amp;c.</note> Who ever ſaw ſuch groſſe Logicall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in one that makes ſuch a flouriſh with Syllogiſticall reaſonings? Who ever ſaw in a ſerious writing ſuch abundance of quotations, ſo generally perverted, or ſo little to the purpoſe? He vainely alledgeth above an 100 teſtimonies of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, old and new, to prove that which was never denyed by thoſe whom he oppoſeth. And yet on the other ſide, who ſo confident of his owne cauſe, amidſt ſuch barrenes of proofe, where there was need of it, either from Scripture or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authours? Let thoſe that ſeem to hold with him in this controverſie, judge whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. be not in theſe reſpects <hi>a Diſputer, one of a thouſand,</hi> as his phraſe is<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 15.</note> elſwhere, to another purpoſe. How comes it then to paſſe, that they that have been induced to write in defence of Preſbyteriall and Claſſicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have had no other matter to work upon, but what was affoorded by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. or that the cauſe of Independencie, which makes ſo great a noyſe among ſome, yeelds yet ſo little to be ſeen for the maintenance of it? May not we juſtly doubt concerning others that ſeem to favour this way, that their judgements are not ſetled in this poynt; by how much they are ſo ſlow to profeſſe, what they hold, and upon what grounds? If they agree with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. and their grounds &amp; pretences be the ſame with theirs, they may here receive ſatiſfaction. But ſome happily will think the Authour hath been needleſly curious in noting the manifold groſſe faylings of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. both in his Reaſonings and Quotations. For anſwer hereunto, beſides that for the moſt part they be ſuch as in this tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough kinde of refuting, uſed by the Authour, could not be paſſed over with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; it appeares that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. ſtands in need of being told of theſe faults; for in his latter edition of the ſame things, I finde not any of theſe foule miſtakes amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Herein onely he hath ſomewhat corrected himſelf, that what he had before<note n="(m)" place="margin">Chur. plea, p. 74, 76.</note> aſſcribed to <hi>Mr Paget,</hi> now he attributes it<note n="(n)" place="margin">Syons prer. roy. p. 16, 21.</note> to the <hi>Preſbyterian governours,</hi> and <hi>ſuch as ſtand for Preſbyteriall government:</hi> hereby acknowledging that what he had before called<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 71.</note>

               <hi>Mr Pagets new opinion,</hi> was neither his device, nor ſole opinion, but common with him to at leaſt all that allow of the government of the Church of Scotland; from whom that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. might profeſſe his diſſent, he hath put in the words <hi>Preſbyterie,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> with <hi>Claſſis,</hi> and <hi>Claſſicall,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Preſbyteries</hi> in Scotland are in effect the ſame with the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> and <hi>Claſſicall,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Preſbyteries</hi> in Sctoland are in effect the ſame with the <hi>Claſses</hi> in theſe countries.</p>
            <p>For the publiſhing of this Treatiſe, I had more need to plead excuſe for not
<pb facs="tcp:112189:17"/>ſetting it forth before, according to their judgement who have frequently called upon me and encouraged me unto the finiſhing of this taſke; rather then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt their diſpleaſure, who are apt to cenſure as unſeaſonable what in this kinde is unwelcome unto them. But for the ſeaſonablenes of it, let the times ſpeak. And for the delay, occaſioned partly by the difficulty of the work, and partly by other diſtractions, &amp; want of neceſſary helps for diſpatch, the book it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto thoſe that are not unacquainted with buſineſſes of this nature, will give reaſonable ſatiſfaction. That which thou here ſeeſt touching Claſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, was written by the Authour in the latter dayes of his pilgrimage, amidſt ſundry bodily weakneſſes, &amp; other neceſſary imployments. There are now three yeares expired, ſince he reſted from this &amp; other his labours, having ſerved the will of God in his owne age, &amp; entred into the joy of his Lord. Being warned ſome time before by a meſſenger of death to deſiſt from the purſuit of this work, he gave way that in convenient time, as I was able, I ſhould huſband theſe his notes for publick uſe. It were to have been wiſhed that his owne eye &amp; hand might have prevented the charge of an executour herein. So ſhouldeſt thou have had this work farre more compleat and refined then now can be expected. But the Almighty, infinite in underſtanding, to whom belong the iſſues of life and death, hath ordered otherwiſe: &amp; who will ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truſt therefore committed unto me, I doe now at length ſet foorth this monument of his godly &amp; painfull labours touching this weighty point of Church-government. I have forborne, as much as might be, to interpoſe my rude pencill in this maſter-piece. The liberty allowed unto me for the perſiting of what was wanting, I have uſed no further then was requiſite, for the coupling of the parts together, out of ſeverall papers, written at ſeverall times, &amp; for the filling up of a few gaps, ſpecially in <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. having had the opportunity to meet with ſome bookes which the Authour wanted. I have withall added a ſmall Supplement, for anſwer unto what remained in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes book, touching this poynt, according to the firſt edition, the ſame which the Authour onely ſaw &amp; followed in this his Defence. And thus I have alſo caſt my mite into this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, before I opened it for publick benefit. If my coine be not currant, let not that prejudice the rich ſupply that may be had out of the Authours ſtore; the value whereof will ſufficiently diſcover itſelf, unto them that with underſtanding &amp; unpartiall mindes receive it. Howbeit, thou art allowed &amp; deſired according to the Authours meaning, to bring it to the touchſtone of trueth, to the Law, &amp; to the Teſtimony. According this word try the reaſons on both ſides, and hold faſt that which is good. Farewell, from DORT: Where a moſt pregnant &amp; effectuall teſtimonie hath been given, for the needfull authority of Synods; with which teſtimony the Authour hath cloſed his writing touching this ſubject: Where this his Treatiſe now comes to light; which we hope may prove uſefull to direct unto the like remedy, where the like caſe may require it. He that hath the Starres in his right hand, ſo guide the beames of this Candle, now ſet upon the Candleſtick, that it may give light unto all that are in the houſe; that the darke corners of errour may be further diſcloſed, &amp; the luſtre of his owne Ordinances becomes more apparent.

               <p>By that which is ſayd it may appeare that the Queſtion is not, whether the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the keyes be given to the Church, or whether the power of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be in the body of the Church, or whether Church-government ought to be with the peoples free conſent, &amp;c. All this may be granted, and yet the point in controverſy remaine undecided. But the difference is about the execution &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall exerciſing of this power: Whether every offence to be judged or cauſe to be determined, ought to be brought to the multitude or body of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they to give their voyces therein together with the Officers of the Church; or whether the Officers being choſen with the publick knowledge and free conſent of the Church, have not by vertue of their calling power to heare &amp; judge matters, to rebuke and cenſure offenders without the adviſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; yet ſo that in matters of greater importance &amp; more publick concernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as admiſſions, excommunications &amp; abſolutions of members, elections &amp; depoſitions of Officers, &amp;c.) the caſe be made knowne unto &amp; determined with the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, according to the practiſe above-written.

If the Deacons may diſtribute ſome almes u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to the poore without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the whole Congregation; then may the Elders alſo judge ſome cauſes without the knowledge of the whole Church. But the firſt is true. Therefore. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is proved by this: Becauſe the whole Church hath as much right &amp; authority to diſpoſe of the Church-treaſure &amp; almes, as they have to judge of the offences that are committed therein. This the Scripture ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the examples of ſundry Churches, of Antiochia, Macedonia, Achaia, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.25-28. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1.4.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. <hi>with c.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption is manifeſt, and your owne practiſe confirmeth it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If Arbiters choſen by conſent of ſome particular perſons may judge the cauſes of wrong &amp; injury, whether publick or private, wherein they ſtrive againſt one another; then may the Elders choſen by conſent of the whole Church, judge the cauſes &amp; offences that ariſe, when they willingly ſubmit unto the ſame. But Arbiters ſo choſen may judge the cauſes referred unto them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders may doe it alſo.</p>
               <p>The truth of the Propoſition appeares; becauſe the free &amp; ſolemne conſent of the Church in any election gives authority unto ſuch perſons, either in generall or ſpeciall workes, as well as the choyſe of any particular men in their cauſes. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19.</p>
               <p>The truth of the Aſſumption appeares, by the doctrine of the Apoſtle giving ſuch power of judgement unto Arbiters: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5.</p>
               <p>If you anſwer hereunto as you<note n="(l)" place="margin">H. Ainſ. Animadv. to Mr Clyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, p. 43.</note> elſwhere expound this place: that theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies to be referred unto Arbiters, <hi>are for civill things of this life;</hi> that <hi>ſuch are not Church-matters, nor there to be heard, &amp;c.</hi> this is inſufficient and will not help you, ſeeing it appeares by the text that theſe Controverſies in Corinth might as well have bene ſayd to be Eccleſiaſticall cauſes as Civill, and belonging to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church as of the Magiſtrates or Arbiters. Had their controverſies bene touching a wound or ſtroke given, touching any ſlander or theft, which may be ſayd to be Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as belonging to the judgement of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112189:19"/>Church; yet might the Apoſtle have ſayd unto them thereupon all that he doth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1-9. for 1. Theſe are buſineſſes which Infidell Magiſtrates in thoſe times uſed to judge, and the generall ſpeech of the Apoſtle imports as much, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 2. The reaſon which the Apoſtle uſeth, taken from the honour &amp; dignity of Saints in their judgement of Angels &amp; the world, ſerves to perſwado them to ſubmit the judgment of ſuch cauſes to one another mutually as well as any other cauſes, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. 3. The reaſon taken from their ſhame, as if there were no wiſe men among them to judge theſe cauſes, ſerves to reprove them for a want of wiſedome in Eccleſiaſticall things as well as Civill. 4. The matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy among them were of wrong &amp; injury done to brethren, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. And theſe being ſinnes &amp; ſcandals, belong to the judgment of the Church, as doth the judgment of<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 10.4, 5, 6. 1. Cor. 5.7.</note> all knowne ſinnes.</p>
               <p>This Argument is in effect yeelded unto by your ſelf, when you<note n="(m)" place="margin">H. Ainſ. Animadv. to Mr Clyf. ton. p. 9.</note> allow the Articles of the Diſcipline agreed upon in the Reformed Engliſh Church which was at <hi>Franckford</hi> in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> dayes; for whereas in the 62. art. thereof, in caſe of difference betwixt the Governours of the Church &amp; others it is there concluded, <hi>that the body of the Congregation may appoint ſo many of the Congregation to heare &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſayd matter or matters, as it ſhall ſeeme good unto the Congregation:</hi> hereupon in approbation of this Diſcipline you obſerve, that <hi>hereby the reader may ſee what the learned &amp; moſt conſcionable of the Church of England held heretofore: which if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, would have freed them of all Antichriſtian Prelacy, the bane of ſo many Churches.</hi> And hereupon I obſerve further againſt you, how the reader may hereby ſee, that if the body of the Church may appoint ſo many Arbiters as they will <hi>to heare &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine matters,</hi> then may the Elders of the Church receive this authority as well as any others; then is it no unlawfull uſurpation for them to heare &amp; determine ſome matters among the brethren by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If particular perſons may lawfully paſſe by ſome leſſer offences &amp; leave them unto the conſciences of the offenders, without proſequuting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Church for any judgment at all: then may the Church alſo leave ſome leſſer offences unto the judgment of the Elders. But the firſt is true. Therefore the ſecond alſo.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Propoſition is proved; becauſe God doth no more require the Church to judge of ſinnes made knowne unto the ſame, then he doth require particular perſons to proſequute and to deale againſt the offences made knowne unto them: the Scripture ſpeaking as fully &amp; giving unto particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ample commiſſion &amp; charge to<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. Lev. 19.17.</note> admoniſh and complaine of ſinne, as it doth unto the Church to judge &amp; cenſure the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption is proved: 1. By expreſſe teſtimonyes of Scripture, that teach us to paſſe by ſome ſins &amp; offences, and not to proſequute them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.21. 2. Particular perſons being taught to love their neighbour as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp; to doe good unto all, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8. are thereby bound to admoniſh them that are without, thoſe that are not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church with them, but of any other eyther true or falſe, or of none. Now if this be to be done, it followes neceſſarily that the reproofes of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112189:20"/>many leſſer faults are to be omitted; becauſe otherwiſe men could never diſcharge this duety, neither would their time ſuffice to performe theſe dueties of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to all ſuch as they ſhould finde ſubject thereunto both within the Church &amp; without. Yea ſuppoſe they had no other calling to attend upon, yet could not the whole age of man be ſufficient to teſtify effectually &amp; in order againſt all ſuch tranſgreſſions which an intelligent perſon might diſcerne to be committed dayly before his eyes, both in private &amp; publick. 3. Even yourſelf ſeem to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this alſo, when touching the difference of offences you ſay,<note n="(i)" place="margin">Com. of Saints. cap. 22. § 2. &amp; 3.</note> 
                  <hi>when offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ariſe, it ſhalbe our</hi> glory <hi>if we can</hi> paſſe them by, <hi>as Solomon hath ſayd. But if the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe be ſuch as we may not but inſiſt upon, both for the honour of God who is offended, &amp; ſoule of the ſinner which is endangered, &amp; our owne or neighbours good who are endammaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: then are we bound to admoniſh the treſpaſſer hereof, &amp;c.</hi> Doth not this diſtinction of offences &amp; different manner of dealing allowed by yourſelf, ſhew that for ſome treſpaſſes we are not bound to admoniſh the treſpaſſer, nor to inſiſt upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If Magiſtrates may lawfully paſſe by the judgment of ſome leſſer ſinnes, then may the Church alſo paſſe by the publick cenſure of ſome leſſer offences. But the Magiſtrates may doe it. Therefore the Church alſo.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the Propoſition appeareth, becauſe the Church is not more ſtrictly bound to judge any ſinne then the Magiſtrate is: his commiſſion for the judgement of all kinde of ſinne, great or ſmall, being as large as the Churches; he being ordained of God to keep all the words of his Law, to be a keeper of both Tables, and to judge all evill, according to the nature of it, as well &amp; as farre as the Church is. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.7, 8. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.3. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption appeareth likewiſe to be true, from the firſt proofe of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the former Argument; as alſo from this that men are ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for bringing their brethren before the Magiſtrates even in caſes of injury &amp; ſinne committed againſt them: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1-8. whereas if they were abſolutely bound to let no ſmall offence paſſe without judgement, then ſhould it alſo be the fault of others not to bring the ſame unto them; &amp; this whether they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians or Infidels, the like law &amp; charge being given unto them both.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The ending of ſome controverſies &amp; judging of ſome publick offences without the knowledge of the whole Congregation, is by yourſelf acknowledged to be lawfull in the approbation of that Diſcipline in the Engliſh Church at Franckford, which was there confirmed by the Church &amp; Magiſtrate. for whereas it was there agreed that<note n="(k)" place="margin">Diſc. of troub. at Franckf. pag 115. &amp;c. art. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>if admonition with witneſses prevayled not, the offence was then to be declared to the Miniſters &amp; Elders, to whom the Congregation hath given authority to take order in ſuch caſes according to the Diſcipline of the Church:</hi> that<note n="(l)" place="margin">Art. 54.</note>

If the power of Excommunication be in the members of the Church now, as the power of putting away leaven was in the Iſraelites of old: then as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Iſraelite under the Law had power of himſelf to remoove leaven out of his houſe, yea &amp; was bound to doe the ſame whether the reſt of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſented or not, as appeares in the places of Scripture here alledged by your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſo now in like manner every particular member of the Church ſhould have power in his hand to excommunicate &amp; remoove a wicked man out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, whether the reſt of his brethren conſented or not. 2.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112189:25"/>of Excommunication is in the body of the Church.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.16. where it is ſayd that <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the preſence of the Lord: 1. It is uncertaine whether it was by an excommunication from the place of Gods word &amp; publick worſhip: Many are ſayd to be caft out of Gods preſence, as we read ſometimes of Iſrael &amp; Iudah, though we cannot ſay that they were then excommunicate. 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 17, 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>20, 23. <hi>&amp; Ier.</hi> 52.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though the face of God doe ſometimes ſignify his all-ſeeing providence &amp; government from which none can flee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7.12. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.24. as you doe<note n="(m)" place="margin">Annot. on Gen. 4.16.</note> write; yet your reaſoning there is imperfect, becauſe the face of God doth ſignify divers other things beſides his all-ſeeing providence &amp; the place of his worſhip, as namely his more comfortable preſence &amp; providence, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>with Iob,</hi> 29.2, 3, 4. whereof men may be deprived though not by excommunication. 2.

                  <p>As for <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. where it is recorded how the ſonnes of God tooke unto them wives of the daughters of men according to their luſt; I would faine ſee how by any lawfull argument you can hence conclude either your Separation, or the peoples power in excommunicating: when your argument appeares in the forme of it, it will then be time enough to ſhape an anſwer unto it. In the meane time, whereas you<note n="(o)" place="margin">Annot. on Ge. 6.2.</note> note that by <hi>the daughters of men are meant they of Kains poſteritie, that out were of Gods Church, &amp;c.</hi> you might as well have ſayd that they had bene of Sheths poſteritie, which was alſo degenerate, ſo that for their wickednes they were ſwept

Who can ſay that the poſterity of Cain for more then a thouſand yeares together were ſtrangers from the Church of God, during the time of ſo many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes; or that ſome of Sheths poſterity alſo did not ceaſe to be the Church of God? And if the teſtimony of your Hebrew doctours were to be admitted, I might eaſily ſhew you many of them that tell us of Cains repentance, &amp; conſequently of the receiving of him &amp; his poſterity into the Church of God. Yea if Naamah was the wife of Noah as they<note n="(p)" place="margin">R.

                  <p>Touching <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. though Iaphet was to be perſwaded to dwell in the tents of Shem, &amp;c. yet how are we to be perſwaded thence touching the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among them, and that the power of excommunication was in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rather then in any Rulers among them?

                  <p>Touching <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. where Abram is called out of his native country: 1.

               <p>H.

And if they anſwer, they are bound to aſſemble for to excommunicate him, but not to heare, him by the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in the triall of his cauſe; they may as well teach the people they are bound to come to eat the bread and wine in the Lords ſupper, but not bound to heare the word teaching &amp; preparing them hereunto.</hi> ANSVV. 1. In coming to the Lords ſupper every man is bound unto a ſpeciall &amp; particular examination &amp; preparation of himſelf, &amp; by his owne knowledge to convince &amp; judge himſelf: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 31. but in coming to the excommunication of offendours a man may lawfully content himſelf with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of others touching their conviction, and ſo reſt in the judgment of the Church; <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15, 16, 17. <hi>&amp; ch.</hi> 17.8-13. neither doth the Scripture in any place require more of us. 2. A man may be fitted &amp; prepared unto the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though he doe not heare the word of God taught and preached at the ſame
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112189:27"/>time when he comes thereunto. True faith &amp; repentance make men worthy &amp; lawfull communicants &amp; able to diſcerne the body of the Lord, though by ſome meanes they be hindred from hearing the Word immediately before. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.40. And therefore to follow you in your owne compariſon; as a man may lawfully come to the Lords ſupper, though he have not heard the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: ſo may he lawfully come to the excommunication of a ſinner, and conſent thereunto, though he have not bene preſent at his conviction before, but onely heare it teſtifyed by others. 3. If you finde no difference, but that men are alike bound to come to heare the examination &amp; conviction of offendours, &amp; to come to the Lords ſupper; why doe you not then cenſure thoſe among you that after your Sermon ended doe depart, when you enter upon theſe convictions &amp; diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, continuing ſometimes untill eight, nine, or tenne a clock in the night, as well as thoſe that after Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould depart &amp; refuſe to eat the Lords ſupper with you?

Thus doe we alſo underſtand the Law: but the Queſtion is whether all the meanes for the right and holy performance of this judgement of excommunication cannot be uſed, unleſſe all the members of the Church be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the conviction of the excommunicate. The reader is to conſider whether this be juſtly proved by you.</p>

But could not the people know that an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later were duely convicted, unleſſe they themſelves were all preſent at his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; conviction? By this kinde of reaſoning, 1. You condemne the juſt &amp; lawfull warre undertaken againſt the enimies of Church &amp; Common-wealth: you might as well ſay that becauſe no ſouldier may ſlay the innocent, therefore every particular ſouldier is bound to be preſent in the aſſembly of the Rulers, where the cauſe of the warre is tryed, and there to heare the examinations &amp; convictions of the wrong-doers. But how was this poſſible in Iſrael, where ſo many hundred thouſands were ſometimes aſſembled together unto the warre? 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or how ſhould it now poſſibly be obſerved in our times? how ſhould private ſouldiers with good conſcience goe into the field, unleſſe they may reſt in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Governours touching the cauſe of the warre? 2.

Here you allow a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of offendours by ſuch as have not bene preſent to ſee their conviction. 11. Your errour in this allegation may likewiſe appeare in this, that thoſe who are excommunicate by one true Church are alſo to be rejected by other true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that have not bene preſent to ſee the conviction of ſuch perſons. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.

               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>He that ſtands out to excommunication, will commonly plead his cauſe to be juſt, and complaine that the Elders have perverted judgment: with what comfort of heart can the people now excommunicate him, if they have not heard the proceedings againſt him, and yet muſt execute the Elders ſentence upon him? Let wiſe men judge whether this be not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tyranny, which the Elders would bring upon the conſciences of the Church.</hi> ANSVV. I. They which conſent to the excommunication of a perſon judged by the Church, and doe thereupon reject his fellowſhip; may have the ſame comfort of heart, which your people ordinarily have when themſelves upon divers occaſions being preſent neither at the conviction of offendours, nor at the pronunciation of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them, doe yet reſt in the teſtimony &amp; ſentence of others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon avoyd ſuch an excommunicate, though he plead his cauſe to be juſt &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that the Elders &amp; others of the people have perverted judgement. II. They may have the ſame comfort of heart, which divers of your people have, being ſouldiers here in the ſervice of the City, who together with the reſt of the ſouldiers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112189:28"/>doe at the Magiſtrates appointment attend upon the execution of juſtice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe malefactours, as pyrates &amp; others; and though they have not heard the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt them, though they have not bene preſent at the examination and conviction of ſuch perſons, doe yet help to execute the Magiſtrates ſentence upon them, being ready to aſſiſt &amp; defend the executioner, if need ſhould require; even then when the condemned perſons doe ſtil plead that they are innocent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that the Magiſtrates have perverted judgement againſt them. Thus you may ſee how this your kinde of reaſoning brings blood upon the head of your people, and ſo upon your owne &amp; your Churches head for retaining of them. II. They may have the ſame comfort of heart, which the Iſraelites had in avoyding the Lepers, &amp; putting them out of the campe upon the teſtimony of the Prieſts, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.2-46. though they had not bene preſent at the proceedings, nor come together to ſee the markes &amp; tokens of the leproſy; and this even then when the Lepers did plead that they were cleane, &amp; complained that the Prieſts had done them wrong. IV. The manner of proceeding againſt offendours, both in the Reformed Churches &amp; in our particular Congregation, is ſuch that any of the people may ſufficiently informe themſelves both touching the matter of fact &amp; right in any queſtion &amp; cauſe, before the ſentence of excommunication be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: They have liberty &amp; opportunity to deale with the parties accuſed, and with the Elders alſo; and this not onely with either of theſe apart, but alſo if they will, to heare the conviction of the offendours before the Elders. Yea the cauſe of ſuch offendours is ſo often publickly propounded to the whole Congregation, and the people are ſo often exhorted &amp; ſtirred up to admoniſh &amp; deale with thoſe which are run into ſcandall, that they may fully diſcerne the guiltines of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before they be caſt out; and therefore cannot by wiſe men be judged to be under any ſpirituall tyranny for conſenting unto the rejection of thoſe, whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity &amp; obſtinacy they may ſo plainly underſtand. V. If the law of God may be expounded according to thoſe ſelect interpretations of the Rabbines, which you make ſpeciall choyſe of &amp; commend unto our conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> above others; then are the people to execute the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Elders, though the proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be kept in farre greater ſecrecy then we require. for expounding thoſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not walke a talebearer,</hi> you ſay thereupon,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Annot. on Levit. 19.16.</note> 
                  <hi>As this Law immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the former about the Iudges; ſo the Hebrewes apply this precept unto them, ſaying, It is unlawfull for any of the Iudges, when he goeth out from the judgment hall, to ſay, I am he that doth acquit or condemne; and my fellowes are againſt me: but what can I doe, ſeing they are moe then I.

For if the Elders were onely bound to utter and pronounce a ſentence of excommunication, when the people are gathered to heare the ſame; then ſhould the Elders deſerve no more maintenance then the people. If the Paſtour were not bound to ſtudy all the week &amp; to take paines to prepare himſelf for the miniſtery of the word and Sacraments, but did onely ſpeak the ſame without labour going before; then could not the double honour &amp; maintenance mentioned, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, be due unto him. Where there is no ſpeciall work, there is no ſpeciall maintenance. And therefore while you doe not require double labour of the Elders in trying caſes, but doe binde the people even to the ſame labour of enquiring, examining &amp; trying matters, how can you require double honour &amp; ſuch ſpeciall maintenance for them? But after this generall evaſion, you proceed unto ſome more particular anſwers, &amp; ſay there in your Animadverſion:</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>Firſt, they reſtrain things too much, when they ſay</hi> between brother &amp; brother: <hi>for what if it be a publick caſe of hereſy oridolatry, as that mentioned Deut.</hi> 13.12, 13, 14. <hi>&amp;c. will they ſay</hi> women, children &amp; ſervants <hi>were then, or are now bound to leave their callings, &amp; come together to try out the matter?</hi> Hereunto I reply. I. They reſtrain things no otherwiſe then Chriſt himſelf doth, when ſpeaking generally of the ſundry ſorts of ſinne, he alſo notes them to be <hi>between brother &amp; brother,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If thy brother finne againſt thee. Matt.</hi> 18.15. Even to publick ſinnes of hereſy and idolatry, as that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. though immediately they are committed againſt God; yet as they are ſcandals and occaſions of falling unto others, ſo are they caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man &amp; man, brother &amp; brother, to be cenſured &amp; judged by them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112189:29"/>
                  <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.5, 6, 13. II. If they reſtrain things too much, then doe they no wrong unto you but unto themſelves: then is there more force in the matter, then their words doe make ſhew of. For if it be unmeet to binde all the members of the Church to heare caſes dayly between brother &amp; brother even in a ſtricter ſenſe, as you would have their words to ſound; how much more inconvenient ſhall it be, when by a larger bond they ſhal be required to heare all caſes of ſinne, both betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brother &amp; brother, &amp; between the Lord and our brethren? III. What ſenſe or reaſon have you to make this queſtion, <hi>Will they ſay &amp;c.</hi> whereas it is not they, but you which ſay &amp; plead by all this your arguing, that women, children &amp; ſervants are bound to leave their callings &amp; come together to try out theſe controverſies?</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>Secondly, many controverſies between neighbours, are for civill things of this life: ſuch are</hi>

Even the controverſies about Civill things of this life, are Church-matters &amp; there to be judged, ſeing all ſinnes are there to be judged. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.15-17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. If you could prove that men did never make falſe &amp; deceitfull bargaines, nor uſe falſe weights, nor any kinde of extortion, oppreſſion, cooſenage, &amp;c. then might you exclude contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies for Civill things from the judgement of the Church. And the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about theſe things being proſequuted before the Church cannot but require a greater time for the examination of them, then the callings &amp; workes of men, women, children &amp; ſervants can well afford: ſo that the force of the argument by this exception is not diminiſhed, but further manifeſted hereby. II. For one &amp; the ſame ſinne God hath appointed two judgements, one Civill, another Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall: as for example, if a man ſhould refuſe to divide the inheritance with his brother; this man by the Magiſtrates might be forced thereunto; and this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Civill adminiſtration. And this is that which our Saviour remooves from himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.13, 14. Againe, the ſame man for his deceit, covetouſnes &amp; ſinfull oppreſſion of his brother uſed in this controverſy for Civill things of this life, might juſtly be cenſured by the Church &amp; excluded from the ſame; which is an Eccleſiaſticall judgement and adminiſtration. You cannot ſhew any place of Scripture, that denyes this judgement unto the Church. Moreover our Saviour at that time was none of the ordinary Iudges, no not in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. He did not in his life time erect another judicatory beſides that which was already the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſtabliſhed among the Iewes: and therefore did not uſe to excommunicate any or caſt them out of the Synagogue. And if Chriſt did not now ordinarily give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, neither in Civill nor Eccleſiaſticall judgements, how farre is this his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from proving that controverſies for Civill things are to be remooved from the Church? III. As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ſhewing that controverſies for Civill things are to be judged by Magiſtrates, this is not contrary to any thing in the argument, neither doth it weaken the ſame. The cauſes of Murder, Adultery, Theft, Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage, Slander, as they are to be judged by the Magiſtrate, ſo by the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And if all the members thereof, men, women, children &amp; ſervants be bound unto the labour of trying and examining ſuch cauſes, why have they not mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ſame, as well as either Magiſtrates or Eccleſiaſticall Elders? IV. As
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112189:29"/>for matters referred unto Arbiters, ſeeing they are oftentimes matters of ſinne, of wrong &amp; injury (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7, 8.) ſubject in that reſpect unto Eccleſiaſticall cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; this courſe of deciding controverſies doth as wel ſerve for the eaſe &amp; help of the Elders, &amp; ſaves them a labour as well as the people. And therefore the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof doth help to ſhew that there is ſtill no reaſon why Elders ſhould have ſpeciall maintenance, when their eaſe &amp; excuſe from labouring is as much as any others.</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>Thirdly, for doubtfull caſes Eccleſiaſticall, people are to inquire the law</hi>

The people are to aſk counſell of one another alſo, as well as of their Elders, for in the multitude of counſellers is health; <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.14. and all the brethren are to inſtruct, guide and ſupport one another: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17-20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. and by your owne confeſſion they are to be uſed not onely in private, but in<note n="(k)" place="margin">Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adv. p. 40.</note> publick conſultations alſo. Yea beſide this, you acknowledge further, that<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 39, 41.</note> the greateſt Errours, Hereſies, Schiſmes &amp; evils have both ariſen &amp; bene continued by the Elders; that ſometimes they are blinde guides and without underſtanding: and oftentimes they differ in counſell among themſelves; and thus in doubtfull caſes men become more doubtfull by their counſell, and ſo have the more need to conſult among themſelves. If therefore this duety of giving counſell doe lye upon the people and they be bound unto it; this work alone being common to others with the Elders, could not ſhew the double honour &amp; maintenance due unto them, unleſſe ſome other ſtudy and work together with the labour of hearing, examining and judging of cauſes did require the ſame. II. As for <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. the knowledge in the Prieſts lips there ſpoken of, was that which he principally manifeſted in his office of publick preaching the law of God: <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.11. in which office the Elders doe not ſucceed them, and ſo have no ſpeciall maintenance due in that regard. Againe, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Prieſts lips appeared ſecondarily in judiciall cauſes, which they heard, examined &amp; judged. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9-12.2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.7. This power you give unto the people now as well as unto the Elders, who therefore by your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine deſerve no more maintenance for the ſame then doe the people in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. III. Though we grant that Elders are to have their ordinary meetings apart for the Church-affaires, yet doth not your allegation from <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. prove the ſame. for that meeting being upon extraordinary occaſion, to entertaine the Apoſtle Paul and thoſe that were with him, who being new come to Ieruſalem, they came together to ſalute &amp; embrace one another, to heare tidings of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the Goſpel &amp; to rejoyce together in the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. and then conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted further of ſuch things as tended to the edification of the Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You might as well conclude that ſtrangers of other Congregations ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ordinary aſſembly of the Elders, becauſe we doe here read of ſome ſuch who being in Pauls company were now alſo preſent at this ſpeciall meeting of the Elders in Ieruſalem. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>Fourthly, when apparant ſinners ſo convicted by witneſſes, are to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112189:30"/>by the Church: there is no time more fit then the Sabbath day; wherein all men are board to leave their owne works,</hi> (<hi>Exo.</hi> 20.10.) <hi>&amp; tend to the Lords, of which ſort this is.</hi> REPL. I. Though I doe not hold it ſimply unlawfull to judge cauſes on the Sabbath day, yet that this day is the fitteſt, your allegation from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. ſhewes it not. Men may then leave their owne works &amp; tend to the Lords, though they heare no controverſies pleaded: yea much more fitly, comfortably and fruitfully may they attend upon the publick adminiſtration of the Word, Prayer &amp; Sacraments, and ſanctify themſelves thereunto in private both by dueties of preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, and by dueties of meditation, repetition, conference, &amp;c. afterward, if the mindes of Miniſter &amp; people be not diſtracted or hindred by other controverſies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Exo.</hi> 19.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.18-21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there hath bene ſuch a diſturbance and hindrance among you, it is teſtifyed not onely by ſtrangers which ſometimes hearing you doe complaine hereof, but alſo by your owne Miniſters, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohnſon &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clyfton, and your owne people, both ſuch as have left you and even ſuch as ſtill remaine with you. II. As Eccleſiaſticall judgements are the Lords works, ſo are Civill judgements alſo, which the Magiſtrates ſitting on the Lords throne in ſtead of the Lord their God, doe adminiſter &amp; execute in his name. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.8. And by this reaſoning you might make the Sabbath to be the fitteſt day for them alſo.</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>Or if that day ſuffice not, they may take any other for them convenient: for &amp;c.</hi> REPL. You doe hereby yeeld unto us that you have walked in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane way, and that you have (according to your owne doctrine) an uncleane and polluted people. for ſeeing as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohnſon confeſſeth &amp; witneſſeth,<note n="(m)" place="margin">Treat. on Matt. 18. p. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner hath bene to heare matters on the week day; at which time there was ſeldome half the Church together:</hi> if now according to<note n="(n)" place="margin">Anim. adv. p. 42.</note> your former arguing from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. men cannot keep themſelves pure from partaking with other mens ſinnes, unleſſe they ſee &amp; heare the conviction of thoſe whom they doe reject, then hath half your Church together bene defiled many times, while they have conſented to the excommunication of ſuch, at the hearing and examination of whoſe cauſe they have not bene preſent.</p>
               <p>H. AINSVV. <hi>For unto publick affaires the Church is to be aſſembled.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.4, 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.18-22. REPL. This your generall and indefinite ſpeech doth admit many exceptions: for I. Even the Elders when they have their meetings apart, as you grant unto them, doe conſider together of the publick affaires; and there you ſee then that the Church is not alwayes to be aſſembled unto publick buſines. II. If the whole Church and all the members thereof, men, women, children and ſervants muſt aſſemble to heare the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt them whom they are to avoyd &amp; reject, according to your plea; and this alſo on the week dayes though it ſhould be day after day, as may come to paſſe in great Congregations and when many caſes are to be heard, &amp;c. as was<note n="(o)" place="margin">R Clyfr. Advert. p. 42.</note> before objected unto you: what reaſon is there that the Elders ſhould have ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maintenance in reſpect of this work, where all the members of the Church are bound to attend upon the work as well as they? To this you ſay nothing. III. Even unto the publick adminiſtration of the word and prayer, you doe not binde
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112189:30"/>your people on the week day, but leave it free for them to come or not to come unto the ſame: And ſhall the hearing of examinations &amp; proceedings againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men have more honour then the word preached? Yea which is much more, by this your opinion and reaſoning you doe more binde your people to be preſent at controverſies even on the week day, then to heare the word and prayer even on the Lords day: for to be abſent from judiciall proceedings on the week day doth not onely require acknowledgment of a fault, as doth the abſence from publick worſhip on the Lords day, but by your doctrin it doth alſo require a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; repeating of the proceedings, or elſe a refuſall to allow the ſame in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking or rejecting them who are publickly cenſured, rebuked or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Church. IV. As in reſpect of the eaſe &amp; commodity of the Church, the hearing of ſome publick affaires is to be committed to the Elderſhip, as hath bene ſhewed before; ſo alſo for the avoyding of ſcandall &amp; offence. for example: the examination of each particular act and circumſtance ſerving for the conviction of offendours in ſome uncleane &amp; filthy ſinnes, and the open repetition &amp; naming hereof before the whole Congregation, men &amp; women, young &amp; old, your owne people &amp; ſtrangers that come to heare, cannot but be very offenſive, &amp; ſo is found to be: for <hi>it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of the things which are done of many in ſecret. Eph.</hi> 5.12. And even ſhame it ſelf (as it ſeemes) hath forced you ſometimes to leave this your practiſe, which you ſo earneſtly plead for: As heretofore in the caſe of H. C. it is teſtifyed, that in the examination of an uncleane fact imputed unto him, there were certaine men deputed to heare and examine the cauſe apart from the Congregation, that the eares of women and children and of the whole multitude ſhould not be offended therewith. And why may you not now ſtill by the like reaſon yeeld that the hearing and examining of offendours may be done apart by the Elders which are the Churches deputies thereunto, as well as heretofore by ſome other deputies new choſen?</p>
               <p>Touching the Scriptures alledged by you, although that which is ſayd already might ſerve for anſwer thereunto, yet this in particular may be further conſidered. As for 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. there is not a word of the Churches meeting together to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the fact of the inceſtuous perſon, but onely of giving ſentence after it was ſufficiently knowne. In <hi>Act.</hi> 14.27. we read that the Church was gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and ſo with us both on the Lords day and on one of the week dayes there is a gathering of the Church together. What an idle thing is it to prove that there ſhould be publick aſſemblies of the Church, which none denyes? But this place ſhewes not that the Church was gathered together to the publick examination of ſcandals &amp; to heare the proceedings againſt offendours, according to the queſtion in hand. As for <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. the <hi>receiving by the Church</hi> there mentioned doth not ſo much as ſhew that the Church was then gathered together. The Church might be ſayd to receive Paul &amp; Barnabas &amp; ſome others with them, and to heare what things God had done by them, though not in a publick aſſembly met together for that end: even as the Church of Rome might be ſayd to receive Phoebe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2.) though not in a publick aſſembly; &amp; Gaius might be ſayd to be the hoſt of the whole Church (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.23.) &amp; conſequently to receive the ſame, though
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112189:31"/>not gathered together at one time. In <hi>Act.</hi> 15.30. Luke ſhewes that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of the Apoſtles was delivered to the multitude aſſembled at Antiochia. So we read that the Epiſtle written to the Coloſſians was to be read in the Church of the Laodiceans: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.16. So the letters and decrees of Princes &amp; States at this day are often times upon ſundry occaſions delivered and openly read to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude &amp; people in ſeverall cities aſſembled and called together to heare the ſame, even as theſe decrees of the Apoſtles and Elders were delivered in ſundry places: <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. But doe theſe manner of aſſemblies prove that no caſes of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, ſcandall or ſinne may be examined &amp; heard by the Rulers &amp; Governours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſence of the people gathered together in ſuch an aſſembly, according to the queſtion betwixt us? How can ſuch kinde of collections be ever juſtifyed by you?</p>
               <p>That place, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18-22. is oft alledged by you to ſhew the peoples power, while it is there ſayd, that <hi>the multitude muſt needes come together;</hi> touching which words, though neither the Syriack nor the Arabick verſions of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have them; though the want of theſe words from the text in this place is by<note n="(p)" place="margin">Inn.

Neither doth any thing hinder but that the word here alſo in <hi>Act.</hi> 21. may be taken in like ſenſe, viz. that the multitude would needs come together, though not bound by duety thereunto. 2. Suppoſe that this comming together of the multitude was according to duety, yet ſeing that both the occaſion was extraordinary, &amp; that alſo the forme of their comming together is not ſpecifyed, whether they were to come as hearers onely of Pauls doctrine, or as judges in judiciall manner to examine him; how can you now conclude from hence that all caſes of controverſy among brethren are ordinarily to be examined by the multitude of the Congregation in a publick aſſembly?</p>

As the Elderſhip of a particular Church conſiſts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters &amp; Elders choſen out of the ſame, ſo the Claſſis conſiſts of many Miniſters &amp; Elders ſent from many Churches, &amp; aſſembling together to heare &amp; determine the caſes above written.</p>
               <p>That the State of the Queſtion may yet more clearly be underſtood, it is to be remembred that in this combination of Claſſes and Synods, I. The authority which they exerciſe is not abſolute, nor their decrees held to be infallible, but to be examined by the word of God, and not to be received further then they doe agree therewith. And therefore alſo<note n="(a)" place="margin">Kercke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ordeninge Synod. Nat. Dordr. art. 31.36.</note> there is liberty of appeale from them, from the Claſſis to the Synod, and from a Provinciall Synod to a Nationall. II. The authority of Claſſes &amp; Synods is not Civill, neither have they power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Civill puniſhments; they<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. art. 30.</note> judge onely of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes &amp; that in Eccleſiaſticall manner, uſing no other then ſpirituall cenſures. III. In the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall union &amp; conſociation of neighbour Churches,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid. art. 84.</note> no one Church hath any prerogative or power above another, nor any one Miniſter or Elder greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112189:32"/>then another: but their queſtions are determined by moſt voyces; and they are all mutually &amp; equally ſubject unto one another in the Lord. IV. This go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Churches by Claſſes doth not deprive particular Churches &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of their liberty &amp; power, but ſerves to direct &amp; ſtrengthen them in the right uſe &amp; exerciſe of their power: for example, when a particular Church with their Elders or the greater part of them agree together to chooſe a Miniſter that is offenſive or unfit for them, if the Claſſis upon due conſideration of the matter doe diſanull their election &amp; hinder their proceeding, yet doe they not hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their liberty nor take from them their priviledge of election, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they doe ſtill leave unto them a freedome to chooſe another fit Miniſter; they doe not in this caſe goe about to chooſe for them, or to obtrude upon them another Miniſter againſt their will, but onely exhort them to uſe their power and liberty aright, and to ſhew more care and godly wiſedome in ſeeking out ſuch an one as may be more inoffenſive &amp; fit for the edification of their Church.</p>
               <p>Againſt this authority of Claſſes and Synods divers oppoſites have riſen up and have pleaded for a new kinde of Diſcipline, contrary to the order of all Reformed Churches, and contrary to that Reformation which the ancient Non-conformiſts in England have ſo much deſired &amp; laboured for. And yet many of theſe Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites doe in the meane time in generall termes ſeeme to<note n="(d)" place="margin">Mr Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob in his Aueſtation of Church-gov. p. 118. &amp; 178. Churches plea. p. 94.</note> embrace Synods and greatly to approve of the benefit that comes by them. But herein is the poynt of difference, that they doe limit &amp; confine all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction within the bounds of a particular Congregation. Though they acknowledge Synods to be lawfull, expedient and neceſſary; yet this they hold to be onely in regard of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell &amp; adviſe, for provocation, direction &amp; countenance: but doe not acknowledge them to have any authority to give ſentence for the deciſion of cauſes; they doe not allow Claſſes or Synods to uſe any Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction or cenſure in judging the controverſies that ariſe in particular Congregations.

                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Chap. 2. art. 3.6. &amp;c.</note> this their opinion is moſt plainly &amp; peremptorily propounded.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112189:32"/>and that in things which he calls proper unto themſelves, this he ſaith<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 230.</note> 
                  <hi>is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject particular Churches under an undue power:</hi> this he calles <hi>an uſurped power.</hi> Now then behold what this <hi>eſtimation &amp; reverence</hi> is which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. allowes to Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call aſſemblies or Synods; viz. not ſo much power as is allowed to any one man, though it were the moſt ignorant and offenſive that is a member of a particular Church. for when a controverſy ariſeth about the election of a Miniſter, the one half of the Congregation giving voyces for him, another half excepting againſt him as unſound in doctrine &amp; unfit for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; if a whole Claſſicall aſſembly of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters &amp; Elders deputed from all the Churches round about doe alſo except againſt him as unſound and unfit, and with one conſent judge that he ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet for one voyce of that one ignorant perſon, whereby the one part of the Congregation comes to exceed the other in number, is that unworthy one to be received &amp; called. This is that <hi>due regard,</hi> that <hi>eſtimation &amp; value</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. affords unto this Claſſis conſiſting of ſo many <hi>grave, learned, prudent &amp; faithfull men of excellent perſonall gifts,</hi> while he maintaines that all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is limited to the particular Church: and all the counſell &amp; brotherly direction of the Claſſis muſt be of no authority againſt the reſolution of ſuch a wilfull company, to cenſure their unjuſt proceedings &amp; to ſtay the ſame. So againe<note n="(m)" place="margin">Apol. repl. p. 47.</note> he pretendeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cartwr. his authority, to prove that <hi>other Churches have no power of hindring a faulty election, but by admonition, which power every Chriſtian hath in another, for his good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeciall or onely remedy which the Oppoſites flye unto in ſuch caſes is the help of the Magiſtrate. But hereby the importance of this Queſtion and the danger of deſpiſing Synods may appeare. Though they hold that Chriſt hath not ſubjected any Church or Congregation of his, to any other ſuperiour Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction then unto that which is within it ſelf, &amp;c. yet they hold<note n="(n)" place="margin">Engl. Purit. cap. 2. § 6. &amp; 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that if in the choyſe of Miniſters any particular Church ſhall erre, that none upon the earth but the Civill Magiſtrate hath power to controule or correct the ſame for it, &amp;c.</hi> that in ſuch caſes others are <hi>to leave their ſoules to the immediate judgement of Chriſt and their bodies to the ſword of the Civill Magiſtrate, &amp;c.</hi> But this help &amp; remedy is weak &amp; inſufficient, &amp; that many wayes: for I. The Churches of Chriſt doe ſometimes remaine under heatheniſh Magiſtrates, that either regard not the cauſe of the Church, &amp; refuſe to judge their controverſies, as Paul &amp; Gallio, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.14, 15. or els ſeek wholly to root out the ſame. II. The Churches are ſometimes diſperſed &amp; ſojourne in the countries of Popiſh Princes and Magiſtrates, as the Churches which at this day live under the Croſſe in Brabant &amp; Flanders &amp; ſundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they keep themſelves as ſecret as may be: and what help can they expect from the Magiſtrates which ſeek to expell them out of their territories? III. Other Churches of Chriſt doe abide in ſuch Popiſh countries where though they be tolerated to have their meetings, as in many parts of France, yet it would be in vaine for them to ſeek help of the Popiſh Governours that have dominion in ſome of the places where they have their abode. IV. In theſe Vnited Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Netherlands, where the Reformed Churches are maintained, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as here is a toleration of many Sects and Religions, and among the reſt of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112189:33"/>the Browniſts, the Magiſtrates doe not uſe to judge their Eccleſiaſticall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, &amp; ſo afford no help unto thoſe Sects in that kinde. When did the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ever ſeek any help from them to repreſſe their contentions and ſchiſmes? V. That or thoſe Churches wich are ſecretly gathered in England according to the direction &amp; example of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacob, doe they not altogether want the help of the Civill Magiſtrate in their controverſies? He preſcribes this remedy,<note n="(o)" place="margin">Neceſſ. of Reform. p. 28.</note> that <hi>if people in their Church-elections, &amp;c. will preſume to be unruly &amp; violent, then the Princes next dwelling Officers of Juſtice may &amp; ought to make them keep peace &amp; quietnes.</hi> But durſt he or his in any of their contentions ever ſeek that remedy? Laſtly, ſuppoſe that in every country the Magiſtrates did ſeek the wealth of Sion and did uſe their authority to correct and puniſh the diſorders committed in true Churches, yet would not this remedy be ſufficient to humble obſtinate offenders, God having appointed other meanes of Spirituall cenſure as well as Civill puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to work upon the conſciences of ſinners, of which more is to be ſpoken hereafter.</p>
               <p>The importance of this Queſtion may further appeare unto us, if we conſider the manifold &amp; great offences &amp; ſcandals which many have the rather fallen into through their neglect &amp; contempt of Claſſes &amp; Synods, and through want of that help which they might have obtained by them.

Yea &amp; further the Church of the Separation did ſo much abhorre to have their cauſes and affaires ſubmitted unto any cenſure or judgement out of their owne Church, that in the excommunication of the father, an old man of 70. yeares, that had undertaken ſo hard a journey (as he confeſſed) for the reconcilement of his ſonnes, &amp; ſought ſuch meanes from other Churches to end their ſtrife, this was ſet downe as one diſtinct &amp; ſpeciall cauſe of his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. <hi>for labouring to draw the Church into Antichriſtian bondage in the the judging the cauſes thereof.</hi> This appeares in the <hi>Copy</hi> of his Excommunication delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him &amp; ſubſcribed by<note n="(r)" place="margin">Daniel Studley.

               </head>
               <p>THe firſt Argument is taken from the ordinance of God delivered by Moſes of old unto Iſrael, where the people of God in particular Congregations were taught to bring their hard &amp; difficult controverſies as well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill unto a ſuperiour Judicatory, unto the Prieſts the Levites, or unto the Judge in thoſe dayes, according to the quality of the cauſe, for the deciding thereof. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8-12. This Order was alſo reeſtabliſhed in the dayes of Iehoſhaphat who placed and ſettled in Ieruſalem an Eccleſiaſticall Synedrion or Senate for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112189:34"/>matters of the Lord, over which Amariah was Preſident, &amp; theſe were to receive the complaints and to judge the cauſes of their brethren that came up unto them from other cities &amp; places of their habitation; even as there was alſo a Civill Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion for the affaires of the King, over which Zebadiah was Preſident. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8-11. This forme of government is commended unto us of David, as the praiſe of Ieruſalem, when he poynts out diſtinctly theſe two kindes of Senates,<note n="(a)" place="margin">See Iun.

Now our preſent controverſy is neither about Ceremoniall ordinances, nor other Judiciall lawes peculiar to the Jewes, but onely about the liberty of Appeales, from one Eccleſiaſticall judicatory to another, from the judgement of a particular Church unto a Synod Claſſicall, Provinciall, or Nationall. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of appeales being granted, then a dependency of Churches is granted, and then the ſingle uncompounded Policie is not to be urged upon us.

Can they from the Jewiſh Policie prove them to be ſubject to the greateſt cenſure, and can they not from the ſame Law procure them liberry of appeale, when they judge they are oppreſſed? Is the Policie of Moſes in force to binde them, and is it then abrogate when they ſeek releef by appeale unto a ſuperiour judicatory? This is indeed an injury &amp; a miſery to Princes &amp; people, to high and low, to be brought into greater bondage under Chriſt in the New Teſtament, then others were under Moſes in the Old.</p>

Seing it appeareth that the order of Eccleſiaſticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſcribed <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. was for the ſubſtance of it no part of the Ceremoniall law, but of common and perpetuall equity, and that the power of Claſſes for the receiving of appeales &amp; judging the cauſes of particular Churches

III. What reaſon had he in deſcribing the uſe of Claſſes to mention this onely, that they were <hi>for the help of Paſtours,</hi> ſeing both they &amp; thoſe judicatories, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. were for the help &amp; benefit of every member of the Synagogues then and the Churches now, as well as for the help of Paſtours?

II. As for the proof he requires, it is moſt plaine and evident from the places alledged: for in them it is manifeſt, that about whatſoever cauſe there was any ſtrife or contention in Iſrael, it might be brought unto the judicatories there mentioned. All Eccleſiaſticall affaires, <hi>all matters of the Lord,</hi> were to be brought unto the Eccleſiaſticall Senate, over which Amariah was Preſident: All Civill affaires, <hi>all matters of the King,</hi> were to be brought unto the Civill judgement, over which Zebadiah was Preſident. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.11. And what controverſy can there be in any Church or Eſtate that may not be reduced to one of theſe? Iunius in his expoſition of theſe places<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Anal.

Was there ever any controverſy or any contention in any Church, which hath not reference to ſome <hi>Law or Commandement?</hi> And ſeeing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. himſelf in theſe diſputes, pretends <hi>the Law and Commandement</hi> againſt us, doe not theſe queſtions therefore, being of ſuch nature, belong unto ſuch judicatories? Seeing judicatories were therefore originally inſtituted, to take away ſtrife &amp; diſſention, as in Civill cauſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.12. ſo alſo in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. and withall ſeeing <hi>the cauſes in queſtion, &amp;c.</hi> have bene ſpeciall meanes and cauſes of diſcord among us; why ſhould not theſe matters be brought unto theſe judicatories for tryall and judgement, as well as others?

                  </gap> In that Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15-20. we have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to us, 1. Three degrees of admonition. 2. A cenſure upon contempt of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. 3. A confirmation of that cenſure.</p>

And further, as Chriſt deſcribes the perſon offending by the name of a <hi>brother,</hi> to ſhew in what loving manner this duety was to be performed to him, ſaying, <hi>If thy brother ſinne againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> ſo had Moſes done before, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> As Chriſt requires not onely a ſimple <hi>telling</hi> of the fault, but a<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>thoroughly to reprove</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> and not to ſuffer ſinne upon a brother. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. <hi>with Lev.</hi> 19.17. As Chriſt in the ſame place to encourage unto this duety, propounds the <hi>winning</hi> of a brother; ſo the Lord in the old Teſtament, ſhewes how <hi>the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,</hi> and how the wiſe doe <hi>winne ſoules. Prov.</hi> 11.30. Thus farre it was no new rule.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond degree</hi> of admonition was with witneſſes: <hi>If he heare thee not, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed.

Hitherto therefore it is the ſame rule.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third degree</hi> of admonition was by the Church, being complained unto and told of the offence. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. This admonition was alſo obſerved in Iſrael, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Church, or thoſe Eccleſiaſticall Governours which repreſented the Church, either in Synagogues, or (as occaſion required) in ſuperiour Judicatories, did <hi>teach, informe,</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> offenders, before they gave ſentence of their obſtinacy and preſumption. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.10.

               <p>The <hi>cenſure</hi> which followed upon the contempt of theſe admonitions was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or rejection of the obſtinate offender. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112189:39"/>the Congregation; Ezra.</hi> 10.8. ſo in the new Teſtament, in an equivalent phraſe, the like judgement was ſignifyed, by denouncing ſome to be accurſed, <hi>anathema.</hi> or ſeparate from the Church of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9. And even in this text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. the cenſure of excommunication being deſcribed by declaring men to be <hi>as Heathens &amp; Publicanes,</hi> there is not onely a manifeſt alluſion and reſpect unto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Jewes, but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the ſame order for avoyding the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, by denying civill communion, of eating &amp; drinking with excommunicates, as they did unto the <hi>Publicanes; Mat.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.2. and both religious &amp; civill communion, both in publick &amp; private, as they did unto the <hi>Heathen: Act.</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.28, 29. neither could this rule be well underſtood without knowledge of the preſent practiſe of the Jewes in this behalf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>confirmation of this cenſure,</hi> is deſcribed in the rule of Chriſt, by a threefold teſtimony and promiſe. 1. That this judgement of the Church given on earth ſhould be ratifyed in heaven, either for binding or looſing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. And ſo Moſes ſetting life and death, bleſſing and curſing, the judgements of God before Iſrael, calles heaven &amp; earth to record for confirmation, to binde them to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thoſe ordinances of God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.26. 2. As Solomon, under the Law, at the building of the Temple, did by his prayer confirme Iſrael in hope of having their prayers to aſcend from earth to heaven; 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.30, 31, 32. ſo Chriſt here promiſeth that the prayers of thoſe which agreed touching any thing on earth, ſhould be granted in heaven. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. 3. As Ioſaphat for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iudaicall Policie, encouraged the Iudges with the promiſe of Gods preſence &amp; aſſiſtance; that <hi>the Lord would be with them in the matter of judgement,</hi> that <hi>the Lord would be with the good:</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 11. ſo here Chriſt to encourage his ſervants in the obſervation of this order promiſeth his preſence, <hi>to be in the midſt of two or three gathered together in his name. verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth from the enumeration of all the ſeverall parts of this rule, compared with the ordinance of God in the old Teſtament, that this is no new rule. Though there were many other Ceremoniall and temporary ordinances in the Law, for the purging of ſinne and uncleannes: yet ſo farre as concernes this Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. there is no new order preſcribed herein; here is nothing ſpecifyed which was not taught before.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſtus nihil hîc novum inſtituit, &amp;c. Chriſt here inſtituted no new thing; but followed the cuſtome alwayes obſerved in the ancient Church of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereby he ſignifyed that the Church could not want the ſpirituall juriſdiction vvhich had bene from the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> And this he alſo applyes unto the juriſdiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in Synods, when he writes,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 9. § 2.</note>

Evang. in Mat. 18.17.</note> The quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, what he meanes by the name of the Church. for Paul commands that the inceſtuous Corinthian ſhould be excommunicated, not by any choyſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but by the whole company of the godly, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 6. and therefore it might ſeeme probable that the judgement is here referred unto all the people. But becauſe there was then no Church which had given the name unto Chriſt, nor ſuch a manner appointed, but that the Lord ſpeakes as of an uſuall and received cuſtome; there is no doubt but that he alludes unto the order of the old Church, even as in other places alſo he applyes his ſpeech unto the knowne cuſtome, &amp;c. So therefore he now had reſpect unto the forme of diſcipline which was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the Jewes: becauſe it would have bene abſurd to propound the judgment of a Church which yet was not. Moreover ſeing the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication among the Jewes, was now in the Elders which repreſented the perſon of the Church, Chriſt fitly ſayth that thoſe which had offended ſhould then at length be brought publickly to the Church, if either proudly they contemned or ſcurrilouſly rejected private admonitions. We know that from the time that the Jewes returned out of the captivity of Babylon, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of manners and of doctrine was committed to that choſen Councell which they called <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

So likewiſe the name of all the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, by Moſes is given to the Elders of the Jewes; that is to ſay, unto certaine choſen &amp; picked out men who were aſſigned by all the Congregation to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the affaires. Thus plainly it is taken in <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. where the Lord appointeth the Congregation ſhall lay hands upon the Levites: but I think no man will ſay this is to be underſtood of all the congregation, that ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhould lay their hands upon them, as are rehearſed then to have bene in the hoſt of Iſrael, but the Elders and Princes onely as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> doth rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it. Which is to be noted the rather, becauſe ſome will have the word of our Saviour to be expounded of all the Church, whereas according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking which the Hebrewes uſe, the Conſiſtory or Councell of the Church is called the Church: Where alſo it is to be obſerved that together with the name, the thing it ſelf is tranſlated from the Jewes unto us: that looke what a Councell the Jewes uſed for the government of the Church, we ought to underſtand by this name that ſuch a one is appoynted by our Saviour to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church. Therefore in the ſame place he attributeth to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the chief government of all Church matters; that all ſuch things as cannot otherwiſe be agreed and ended be at the laſt brought unto them, and ended by their authority &amp; judgement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſecond, the cenſures of the Church, having ſpoken before of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion and proceeding to ſpeak of Excommunication, he ſaith,<note n="(v)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 92.</note> 
                  <q>This part of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, as alſo the firſt, were tranſlated unto us from the Jewes; for the Church of Chriſt in all this matter of Diſcipline hath received all her lawes &amp; decrees from the Jewes: for as it hath bene ſhewed before, it is plaine &amp; manifeſt that our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. alluded to the manner of the Jewes, becauſe that otherwiſe his ſpeech ſhould have bene very obſcure, and ſuch as no man had bene able to underſtand.

How great ſoever the abuſes and corruptions of Governours &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were in Chriſts time; yet were not the godly required then to renounce or forſake the communion of that Church. Chriſt himſelfe both by his example &amp; his commandement taught otherwiſe, whiles he both communicated therewith himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.17, 18. and likewiſe required others to doe the ſame. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.2, 3. Now foraſmuch as the publick worſhip of God and his miniſtery are holy ordinances, as well as the government of his Church; ſeeing Chriſt taught his people to goe unto the worſhip &amp; miniſtery of the Jewes either in Synagogue or Temple, what reaſon is there to think that they ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to repayre unto their government in their Synedrio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Preſbyterie? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as our Saviour taught ordinarily <hi>in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes alwayes reſorted; Iohn.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.23. ſo there were ſome righteous and faythfull men Governours and Rulers of the Jewes in Chriſts time, who though they conſented not unto evill and unrighteous judgements, but teſtifyed againſt them; <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.50, 51. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.50, 51. yet were they not required to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their offices and their government. And if they might lawfully retaine their office and government, why might not others reſort unto them in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſeek redreſſe of offences, and ſo by them <hi>tell the Church,</hi> according to the rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17?</p>
               <p n="3">III. For the further clearing of this poynt, concerning which many are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly minded, and many ſtumble at this day alſo upon occaſion of a like difficulty, minded, and many ſtumble at this day alſo upon occaſion of a like difficulty, doubting what is meet to be done, when corruptions doe abound in a true Church (as the Jewes in Chriſts time were) when as yet ſome of the Miniſters &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof doe become oppreſſours of the godly &amp; perſecutours of the trueth; we are therefore to obſerve divers rules of direction according to which both the Jewes then and Chriſtians now in ſuch caſe are to carry themſelves, 1. There is a difference to be put betwixt the cauſes and matters of complaint, about which men had occaſion to goe to the Jewes Synedrion or Elderſhip. There were ſome kinde of ſinnes, as of open theft, adultery, extortion, ſacriledge, legall impurity, Sabath-breaking &amp; divers the like ſcandals, againſt which the Phariſees and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Jewes were very zealous: <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.18, 21. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.21. And what ſhould hinder the godly from going unto their Preſbyterie to ſeek redreſſe, and ſo to <hi>tell the Church</hi> of ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? In other quaeſtions touching their traditions they had not the like encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to goe unto them. 11. There was a difference to be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Rulers of the Jewes to whom they had occaſion to complaine. As there was a multitude of Synagogues among them, ſo there was great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Rulers of thoſe Synagogues; ſome of them being more modeſt, humble and attentive to the Goſpell then others, as we read of Iairus, Criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,

And to ſuch there was yet the more reaſon to complaine upon occaſion. As for others that ſhewed themſelves open &amp; obſtinate contemners of the Goſpell &amp; perſecuters of Chriſt, our Saviour taught his Diſciples to beware of ſuch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. to fly from them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.54. and not raſhly to caſt the pearles of holy admonition before ſuch as would tread them under their feet, and ſeek to rend the admoniſhers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. <hi>with Prov.</hi> 20.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.8. Paul ſometimes went voluntarily unto the Jewiſh Synagogues. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.4. ſometimes he withdrew himſelf from ſuch as were hardened &amp; blaſphemed; <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 51. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. III. For the perſons admoniſhing, there is alſo a difference to be obſerved betwixt them; ſome of them being weake, and ſome ſtronger. Such of them as were weake in knowledge and weake in reſolution and courage, were taught to take knowledge of their owne infirmity and not to preſume above the grace given unto them, but to wait untill God had further prepared &amp; inabled them, by furniſhing them with ſuch gifts as were meet and required for the performance of great &amp; hard dueties. <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.36, 37, 38. It was required of them that were to goe unto the Elderſhips of the Jewes, and ſo to <hi>tell the Church</hi> of corruptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding among them, that they ſhould be able to argue from the Scriptures &amp; to convince the gainſayers, in publick as well as in private in the firſt degree of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.15. and withall to ſtand conſtantly as yron pillars againſt the faces of unrighteous &amp; cruell men. <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50.7. Peter being yet weak, &amp; preſuming above his ſtrength, did therefore fall ſo greevouſly. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.33.74. But for thoſe that are ſtrong, confirmed in knowledge and godly reſolution, they are to gird up their loynes for the doing of that which is not ſo ſafe for the weake to enterpriſe. And as the Apoſtle giving direction in other caſes, wherein it was alſo ſomething hard to diſcerne and determine what was beſt to be done, requires men to look unto their reſolution &amp; perſwaſion without wavering or fainting (as in the matter of marriage, of going to a feaſt with unbeleevers, and eating of meats then in queſtion) and deſcribes their reſolution in many words, ſaying, <hi>He that ſtandeth faſt in his heart, having no neceſſity, but hath power over his owne will, &amp; hath ſo decreed in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 37. and If any of them that beleeve not bid you to a feaſt, <hi>&amp; ye be diſpoſed to goe,</hi> or as the words are <hi>and ye will goe, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. and <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his owne minde: Rom.</hi> 14.5. So in the caſe of going to <hi>tell the Church</hi> among perſecuters, every man was and is ſtill to ſee that he be ſtrong in the Lord &amp; ſtand faſt in his heart. 1v. Even thoſe that were ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and moſt reſolute, were yet bound to diſtinguiſh the times, and in all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſedome to put difference betwixt occaſions. When Paul went bound in the ſpirit unto Ieruſalem, knowing that bonds &amp; afflictions waited for him there, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.22, 23. there was no intreaty, no teares &amp; cryes of his godly friends could perſwade him to ſtay, or hold him from going up thither to tell the Church and Rulers of the Jewes ſuch things as God called him to witneſſe unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.12, 13, 14. though he was ready to have bene torne in peeces of that Seditious Church. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.10. At another time when Paul being bold as a Lyon would
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:112189:45"/>have adventured himſelf among the tumultuous Epheſians for the defence of his companions in danger, yet not having ſo expreſſe and ſtrong a call thereunto as in the former example, he yeelded to the counſell of others &amp; ſuffered himſelf to be over-ruled: <hi>when he would have entred in unto the people, the Diſciples ſuffered him not. Act.</hi> 19.30. Here is the wiſedome, faith &amp; patience of the Saints; let thoſe that have underſtanding lay theſe examples before them, &amp; labour to apply them unto themſelves upon like occaſions. V. Even thoſe that are the weakeſt alſo are to put difference betwixt unadviſed going of themſelves and a neceſſary calling. for though men ſhould not raſhly expoſe themſelves to danger, yet being brought by others &amp; drawne before a Jewiſh Synedrion, &amp; being examined touching their profeſſion and practiſe, it is then required even of the ſimpleſt to anſwer for the trueth with meeknes &amp; reverence, ſo farre as they know and are able, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, and not to betray the trueth by their ſilence, but to <hi>tell the Church</hi> of the evils to be reformed. Such were and are to remember the promiſes; that <hi>out of the mouth of babes &amp; ſucklings God ordaineth ſtrength, to ſtill the enemy &amp; the avenger: Pſal.</hi> 8.2. that ſuch are <hi>bleſſed</hi> in <hi>ſuffering according to the will of God. Matt.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. And thus according to theſe directions in divers kindes there was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to practiſe in the Jewiſh Church that Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>

               <p n="1">I. That the Ceremoniall law is abrogate, we willingly grant, and ſome of the Scriptures here alledged by them doe prove the ſame: &amp; ſo much of the Iudiciall law as had a peculiar reference unto the ſtate &amp; condition of the Jewes, &amp; did not in common equity concerne other people as well as them, we acknowledge in like manner to be diſannulled, as we have alſo noted<note n="(a)" place="margin">Pag. 36. 37.</note> before. But that the ſpirituall admonitions &amp; cenſures by the Eccleſiaſticall judicatories, were either any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial or Typicall ordinances, or ſuch as doe not agree with the ſtate of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches under the new Teſtament, this remaines for them to ſhew, if they will make good thoſe allegations of Scripture which they apply to ſuch a purpoſe. In the meane time we eſteeme ſuch allegations to ſerve our oppoſites turne no better, then they doe the Anabaptiſts, who upon a like pretence that Moſes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is aboliſhed, and that the Law is changed and old things paſſed away, doe thereupon plead that the Civill power of the Magiſtrate, and the uſe of the ſword is not to be exerciſed by Chriſtians in the Church of God under the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As for thoſe places, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 44. where the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Citie and Sanctuary is foretold, they doe not prove the abolition of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:112189:45"/>that Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction of Synods which we maintaine; becauſe this part of Moſes politie, and this liberty of appeales from one judicatory to another, might have continued even among the Jewes themſelves, though both City and Sanctuary were deſtroyed, and much more may ſtill be retained among Chriſtians, that are not tyed unto the Leviticall prieſthood, nor unto any other legall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. So the inquiſition for murder was an ordinance of Moſes politie: <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.1-9. though divers ceremonies were in Moſes time annexed there unto, this hinders not but that thoſe ceremonies being aboliſhed, the Iudiciall law it ſelf for inquiſition after murders, being of common equity, ought ſtill to continue among us.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is further to be obſerved how ſome of our oppoſites labouring to finde a difference between Moſes politie and Chriſts rule, have deſcribed unto us ſuch a rule of proceeding in Moſes time, as is not to be acknowledged. <hi>Mr Smith,</hi> as is noted<note n="(b)" place="margin">Pag. 42.</note> before, makes this to be the order of proceeding in the time of the Law, 1. reproof of ſinne, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. 2. a ſacrifice for the cleanſing of the party reproved, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.23. 3. death inflicted by the Magiſtrate upon the partie reproved, if he wilfully refuſed to hearken, &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.30, 31. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Mr Ainſworth</hi> agreeth with him in this poynt, &amp; ſayth,<note n="(c)" place="margin">H.

                  <hi>doe gather.</hi> Now for anſwer hereunto, and to ſhew how they were miſtaken about the rule of admonition in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in teaching that men were bound upon admonition to bring an offering, &amp; ſo bound that if they wilfully refuſed or regarded not to doe it, they were to dye or to be cut off from among their people, we are to obſerve that God did not lay ſuch a bond of neceſſity upon his people, and this appeareth by theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">I. The<note n="*" place="margin">vehebi.</note> words of the Text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.23-28. being rightly tranſlated doe not inferre ſuch a bond.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:112189:46"/>bring a ſacrifice for their ſinne, then they muſt doe it in ſuch manner as is there preſcribed. And there is a double reaſon for this tranſlation. I. The particle <hi>vau</hi> is<note n="(f)" place="margin">Vau om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium alia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctionum ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. &amp;c. aliquando conditione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> includit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cevall. &amp; Bertr. in Galeed, p. 44.</note> often and very conveniently expounded conditionally by <hi>if</hi> or <hi>and if,</hi> as <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1, 3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.23. So the principall Interpreters doe ſundry times tranſlate the ſame: the Chaldee Paraphraſts, both <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> as alſo the Greek verſion, in <hi>Num.</hi> 12.14. So the ancient Arabick verſion of <hi>Rabbi Saadias,</hi> as alſo that edition of the Chaldee printed at Conſtantinople in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.23.

And to omit a multitude of other interpreters, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ainſworth himſelf doth ſometimes ſo tranſlate the ſame, as in thoſe places before ſpecifyed, <hi>Exo.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14. and further<note n="(g)" place="margin">Annot. on Lev. 26.40.</note> notes that ſo it ought elſwhere to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.8. II. Suppoſe that the conjunction or particle <hi>vau</hi> were not conditionall in this place, yet the word turned into the future tenſe by <hi>vau hippuc</hi> according to the Hebrew ſpeech, as other ſimple<note n="(h)" place="margin">See Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leed, p. 117.</note> verbs future, doth not alwayes neceſſarily imply a commandement, but rather a permiſſion. Though ſometimes they import an abſolute commandement, as in the Decalogue; yet ſometimes they are uſed to ſignify what we may doe, and what we are permitted to doe. This is commonly obſerved by Tranſlatours, who in their tranſlation of the very ſame forme of the future verb, doe ſometimes expreſſe it by a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding phraſe, <hi>thou ſhalt doe,</hi> ſometimes by a phraſe of permiſſion, <hi>thou mayeſt doe:</hi> for example, in our Engliſh tranſlation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.21, 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.15, 20, <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.20, 24, 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.2. <hi>Thou mayeſt eat, Thou mayeſt lend, Thou mayeſt eat grapes, Thou mayeſt pluck, She may goe, &amp;c.</hi> Thus are many of theſe places tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ainſw. himſelf; and thus in like manner might this place, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.23, 28. be fitly tranſlated, <hi>Then he may bring his offering, &amp;c.</hi> And being ſo interpreted there is no ſuch bond of neceſſity contained therein.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As the words and forme of ſpeech in the Text doe admit this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo the matter it ſelf &amp; the nature of the ordinance doth determine it, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine us to entertaine this tranſlation, which ſhewes it to be a permiſſion: becauſe otherwiſe it had bene impoſſible ever to obſerve it in Iſrael. The ſinnes ſpoken of in <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.2, 27. are for the generall nature of them all manner of ſinnes, great or ſmall, except preſumptuous ſinnes. The words of the Text are, <hi>If a ſoule ſhall ſinne through ignorance againſt any of the commandements of the Lord, concerning things which ought not to be done, &amp; ſhall doe againſt any one of them:</hi> the word <hi>ſchegagah</hi> there uſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining under it all ſinnes of infirmity, ignorance, errour, forgetfulnes or unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Now the holyeſt men on earth being ready to offend on this manner every day &amp; houre; if for every dayly unadviſed word or deed they had bene bound to bring a ſacrifice, &amp; no other way to purge their ſinne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had it bene utterly impoſſible to have kept this ordinance: I. In reſpect of the coſt and charges, eſpecially for the poore, deſcribed by this argument, that he<note n="*" place="margin">hamſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran teru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah.</note> 
                  <hi>wants an offering,</hi> ſo impoveriſhed that he was not able to bring an oblation. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 40.20. The poore ſoule that had but two mites, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.42, 44. and the poore man that had but one lamb lying in his boſome, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. could not purge their dayly ſinnes with ſacrifices for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:112189:46"/>them all: eſpecially conſidering that in this ſinne-offering here ſpoken of, they muſt of neceſſity bring either a ſhee-goat or a lamb-female without blemiſh: <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.28, 32. there was no reſpect of the poore to ſpare them or to diſpenſe with them for bringing a ſacrifice of leſſe price, as yet in other caſes we ſee they were diſpenſed withall. <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.21, 22, 30, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. whereupon the mother of Chriſt being very poore (as appeareth hence) brought a paire of turtle-doves or two young pigeons, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.24. which had not bene lawfull, if ſhe had bene able to have brought a lamb. Now if the Lord had this care to eaſe the burden of the poore leper at his cleanſing, and of the poore woman at her purification, which might fall out to be but once in the yeare, or once in a life time, and to many never in their life; then how much more agreeable is it to the mercy of God, that the charges of the poore ſhould have bene reſpected in thoſe ſacrifices which they might have had occaſion to offer even every day in the yeare? but hence we may gather that this ſacrifice was not of neceſſity impoſed upon them. Yea it had bene impoſſible for the richer ſort to have ſuſtained this charge, eſpecially in the yeares of dearth or ſcarſity. All the cattell upon the mountaines of Iſrael, with the ſheep of Kedar and Nebaioth were not ſo many as the knowne ſinnes of Iſrael, which needed this ſacrifice. II. In reſpect of the labour and travell, this order was not poſſible to be obſerved, when for every knowne ſinne they ſhould take a journey to Ieruſalem, many of the Iſraelites dwelling divers dayes journeys from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Abraham travelling from Beerſheba in the South to offer his ſonne in the mount of Morijah, where the Temple was afterwards built, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.1. came not thither before the third day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2, 3, 4. And ſome others that dwelt in the Tribes Northward from Ieruſalem, were as farre againe diſtant from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as appeares by the<note n="(i)" place="margin">Cl. Ptol. Geogr. l. 5. c. 16. tab. 4.</note> Geographicall deſcription of that country; ſo that to goe and come &amp; to performe that ſacrifice could not be much leſſe then a weeks work unto divers of them: &amp; every week in the yeare they might have occaſion to take this journey, if this ſacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. had bene exacted of them. Yea as Ioſeph &amp; Mary having bene at the feaſt, when they had come a dayes journey homeward from Ieruſalem, ſeeking the child Ieſus and not finding him in the company did returne back againe to Ieruſalem: <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.43, 44, 45. ſo many ſinners having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this ſacrifice and comming homeward, might in the way come to the knowledge of ſome new ſinne, and ſo be forced to goe back to Ieruſalem to offer againe; yea and this ſo often that all their life long they might doe no other work but travell up and downe to offer ſacrifices. But ſeeing it was impoſſible for the tribes and families of Iſrael to endure ſuch travell, we may therefore conclude from hence, that both <hi>Mr Ainſworth</hi> and <hi>Mr Smith</hi> have erred in teaching that Iſrael was bound unto ſuch a rule.</p>
               <p>But againſt this it may be objected from the interpretation of the Rabbines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Mr Ainſworth,</hi> that theſe errours for which the Sinne-offering was to be brought were not ſo many &amp; common, but few and rare, and that therefore there was no ſuch impoſſibility of purging them by ſacrifice. Therefore to cleare the Text, and to vindicate the ordinance of God from the abſurd traditions of the Thalmudiſts, and that it may appeare how men have corrupted the Rules of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:112189:47"/>&amp; diſcipline, as well in the Old as in the New Teſtament, I will briefly poynt out ſome of their vaine gloſſes, &amp; ſhew their contrary extremities about this particular ſtatute.</p>
               <p>The errours &amp; ſinnes for which this ſacrifice was appointed are in one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſtrained too much by the Jew-doctours: I. By expounding them onely of ſuch works and deeds as are diſtinguiſhed from thoughts and from words. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Text ſayth, <hi>ſhall doe,</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">H. Ainſ.

This gloſſe is a vaine and falſe collection: becauſe the H. Ghoſt in the Scripture, doth ordinarily deſcribe the words, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſavings of men under the phraſe of doing, as appeares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>with verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 50.19, 20. <hi>with verſ.</hi> 21. And what reaſon is there that the ſinnes of ſtandering, rayling, curſing, perjury, blaſphemy, being repented of ſhould not be purged by ſacrifice as well as other hainous facts &amp; deeds? II. By a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of theſe errours in deeds and facts unto the tranſgreſſing of negative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements onely. Herein they<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> ſhew themſelves partiall in the Law, dividing it into 613 commandements, &amp; thoſe againe into 248 affirmative co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements according to the ſuppoſed number of bones in a mans body, &amp; 365 negative co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements according to the number of dayes in the yeare: &amp; the ſinne-offering they require onely for the breach of negative co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, pretending a reaſon from the Text, which makes mention of <hi>all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements concerning things which ſhould not be done.</hi> Hereupon they ſay, that no ſinne-offering is to be brought for neglecting of Circumciſion or the Paſſeover, becauſe they are affirmative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. And thus at once they caſt out 248 kindes of ſinnes, according to the number of the affirmative co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, from having any part in the Sinne-offering.

Now if for ſo ſmall a tranſgreſſion as writing with a pen upon the Sabath but half a word, a ſyllable or two letters of a mans name, they were bound to bring this ſinne-offering, and ſo accordingly for other ſinnes of like nature and weight, what man though the holyeſt on earth, could have endured the labour and charge of ſo many ſacrifices as ſuch kinde of ſinnes might have occaſioned?

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:112189:48"/>old, to bring a ſacrifice for each ſinne when it was made knowne unto them; yet this proves not that any new duety was preſcribed in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. which was not taught in the Law before. We know that the legall ſacrifices and ceremonies are wholly abrogate: yet this hinders not but that the morall dueties obſerved in the midſt of thoſe ceremonies may ſtill remaine, when the ceremonies are aboliſhed. When the Miniſters of the Lord in old time entred into their offices with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſent of the people, and together at the ſame time were conſecrated with divers ſacrifices and other ceremonies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.

               <head type="sub">The third Argument, taken from the practiſe of the primitive Churches, in the Apoſtles times.</head>
               <p>OUr third Argument is taken from the practiſe of the primitive Chriſtian Churches, after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, from which we reaſon on this manner: That government of the Church which is commended unto us &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the example of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolick Churches, is worthily to be embraced of us. But the government of the Church by Synods, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their counſell and admonition, doe alſo with authority judge and determine the weightieſt cauſes and affaires of particular Churches, is commended unto us as is above ſayd: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:112189:49"/>
               <p>The Aſſumption of this Argument is proved:</p>
               <p n="1">I. By that holy aſſembly or Synod which is recorded <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15-26. wherein there was not onely counſell given, but alſo an exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall power &amp; authoritie, and that in ſuch a buſines as was of great and rare importance, in the choyſe of a new Apoſtle. This Aſſembly was not an ordinary Congregation or particular Church, but it was a Synodicall aſſembly, and performed ſuch a work as did not belong unto any one particular Church. This appeares divers wayes: I. In reſpect of the perſons of whom this Aſſembly did conſiſt, and theſe againe of two ſorts; Firſt, of Apoſtles, who being ſuch perſons as were not tyed unto any particular Church, but had an univerſall charge; <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15, 18. This commiſſion was unto them as much as if they had had a ſpeciall dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from many or all Churches, ſo that their preſence and concurrence was ſufficient to make this Aſſembly in ſome meaſure, as a generall or univerſall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Theſe eleven Apoſtles having alſo a peculiar charge to be at this time at Ieruſalem, the place of this Aſſembly, and to tarry there for a while (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4.) were by divine direction brought unto this Synod. Secondly, for other perſons, the Diſciples that were preſent at this Aſſembly, it appeares they were from divers places; ſome of them from Galilee, as the brethren of Chriſt there mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14. <hi>with Mat.</hi> 13.55, 56. &amp; how many of them were inhabitants of Ieruſalem or Iudaea, it is not ſpecifyed: ſo that the 120 perſons met together at this time, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſayd to have bene a diſtinct particular Church of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dwelling in Ieruſalem, but an occaſionall aſſembly or Synod upon ſuch ground as the ſtory of the Scripture doth manifeſt. II. In reſpect of the buſines it ſelf here performed, viz. the election of an Apoſtle: it was ſuch a work as did not appertaine unto any one particular Church, but all Churches had intereſt therein, ſeeing <hi>the care of all the Churches</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted unto the Apoſtles. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. All Churches were alike bound to beware of falſe Apoſtles, that could <hi>tranſforme themſelves into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. It had bene a preſumption in any one Church, and a wrong unto all the reſt, if without their conſent, one alone ſhould have choſen an Apoſtle: eſpecially conſidering there were even at this time a multitude of the faithfull in other places whom this work concerned. Many had bene lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the miniſtery of Iohn Baptiſt: <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.12. and now immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſcenſion of Chriſt we read of more then 500 brethren at once which were witneſſes of the Reſurrection of Chriſt. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. Theſe 120 had done injury unto them, ſave that theſe generall perſons, the Apoſtles, called of God for the ſervice of all Churches, did for them by divine appointment appeare in this Synod. III. In reſpect of the manner of this election, which was made with a threefold limitation, 1. Unto one of thoſe men which had companyed with the Apoſtles all the time that the Lord Ieſus went in and out among them, beginning from the baptiſme of Iohn, even untill that ſame day that he was taken up from them. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22. Now theſe Diſciples that thus waited on Chriſt, ſuch as Barſabas and Matthias were, being no inhabitants of Ieruſalem, what power had a particular Church to determine and diſpoſe of them that were no members of their particular ſociety? 2. There was a reſtraint from abſolute electing of any
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:112189:49"/>one of theſe: they were onely allowed to preſent two, and to offer them unto the choyſe of the Lord. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23.24. 3. The way and meanes of inquiring the will of God herein, was determined and reſtrained unto a Lot, whereby the judgment and definitive ſentence of God was declared unto the Synod that reſted therein. And by theſe extraordinary directions it pleaſed God to honour this firſt Synod of the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>It is here alſo to be obſerved, that although ſome Writers have ſpoken of this election as made by a particular Church, yet we have ſundry learned men conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with us in the expoſition of this ſtory, who labouring to ſhew the profit and neceſſity of Synods,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Whitak. de Concil. qu. 1. c. 3.</note> doe argue from this place, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and affirme that in the New Teſtament the Apoſtles and whole Church did celebrate a Synod for the chooſing of Matthias into the place of Iudas. The Profeſſours of Leyden to the ſame purpoſe<note n="(b)" place="margin">Synopſ. pur. Theol. Diſp. 49.</note> alledge this example, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and call it <hi>the firſt Synod at Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The example of that renowned Synod which is recorded <hi>Act.</hi> 15. is a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t warrant, wherein the uſe and authority of Claſſes and Synods is commended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and this not onely for counſell and admonition, but alſo for the judgement of cauſes and for the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction. As that which went before the Synod, namely the great diſſention about a dangerous errour, with ſeeking of redreſſe by a ſolemne deputation of meſſengers from the Church of Antioch (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2.) did call for help in the moſt effectuall manner: ſo the things done in the Synod are an evidence of the authority which they uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, both by a definitive ſentence which they pronounced concerning that contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy which was brought unto them; <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. and by an authentick ambaſſage of choſen men ſent from that Aſſembly of Apoſtles, Elders and brethren, both to carry the Epiſtle that was written, and by word of mouth to declare the ſame things, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 23, 25, 27. That alſo which is noted to have bene done after the Synod in the publication of the acts thereof, doth alſo beare witneſſe touching the authority of thoſe acts, in that they are called <hi>the decrees, ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 16.4. The fruit alſo which by the bleſſing of God followed hereupon, in being a meanes of great conſolation, and eſtabliſhment of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the faith (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.5.) is to be conſidered as an argument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the H. Ghoſt doth further commend unto us the authority of ſuch Synods in the right government of the Church.</p>
               <p>Upon this example doe generally all judicious Writers build the authority of Synods, as upon a ſure foundation &amp; groundwork.</p>

                  <hi>This Text, Act.</hi> 15. <hi>is alledged by Bellarmine to prove the binding force of the decrees of Councills, and by the Anſwerer, to ſhew the authority of the Claſſis: whereunto Iunius giveth</hi> 2 <hi>anſwers alſo.</hi> 1. Non ſequitur ex particulari, ſi cuſtodienda fuerint decreta Concilii Apoſtolici, ergo &amp; omnium ſervari oportere. <hi>It doeth not follow from a particular, that becauſe the decrees of an Apoſtolicall Councill are to be obſerved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decrees of all Councills muſt be ſo kept.</hi>

                  <hi>And whereas Bellarmine affirmeth that the queſtion there was not defined by Scripture, but by the voyces of the Apoſtles, Iunius denyeth that any thing was ordained in that Councill, but from the Scriptures, as he had before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and thereunto referreth the Reader.</hi> ANSVV. I. It may be obſerved here how untrue it is which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. pretends in excuſe of his large writing, ſaying,<note n="(v)" place="margin">Pref. to the Reader.</note> 
                  <hi>For the help of the Reader in comparing the Reply with the Anſwer, I have inſerted his owne words every where.</hi> This hath he not done here, nor in many other places.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. hath neither inſerted mine owne words, nor yet the words of him that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this place. II. In alledging the two anſwers of Iunius unto Bellarmine, he wanders wide from the queſtion in hand. I am of the ſame minde with Iunius in both thoſe anſwers: Though the decrees of that Apoſtolicall Synod were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true and juſt; yet is it not ſo with other Synods, many whereof are to be rejected for their erroneous and unjuſt decrees. All the decrees in that Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. were grounded upon the Scriptures, and reſted not merely upon the ſuffrages of men. Iunius had juſt cauſe ſo to anſwer Bellarmine, that maintained an unlawfull and abſolute authority of Synods, and exacted obedience of neceſſity to all their decrees. Is not this to abuſe both me and his Readers, and to bleare their eyes, that they ſhould not rightly diſcerne the ſtate of the queſtion? III. That the Reader may better conceive in what manner an authority and power is aſſcribed to Claſſes and Synods, let the authority of particular Churches be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as an example and modell of that authority which is in Synods. My op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites themſelves confeſſe that there is in particular Congregations an authority and power to judge and cenſure offendours, and yet they will not deny but that they may erre in their judgements, that they want ſuch infallible direction as the Apoſtles had, and that their decrees and Eccleſiaſticall cenſures are to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no further then they are grounded upon the Scriptures. So is it with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Claſſes &amp; Synods.</p>
               <p>I. DAV.<note n="(y)" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 255.</note> 
                  <hi>And, whereas Bellarmine ſayth that the decree of the Apoſtles was not left to the examination of the Diſciples, but that they were ſimply commanded to obey, Iunius char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:112189:51"/>him with falſely ſuppoſing two things.</hi> 1. That the Apoſtles alone made this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>For the Elders concurred with the Apoſtles in this ſentence, and the whole Church, all of them being taught by the ſpirit of trueth to think the ſame thing.</hi> And this <hi>he ſaith</hi> is the manner of proceeding in thoſe Councills where Chriſt is praeſident. 2. <hi>That the ſame reſpect is to be had to the determination of others, as of the Apoſtles. Which is an errour, he ſayth, For it was the ſingular priviledge of the Apoſtles, that they had immediate aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, and infallibility in their Apoſtolicall determinations. ſo that what they delivered was to be received without examination, whereas the dictates and ſentences of all other are to be examined by their writings: whereby it appeareth that the Scripture acknowledgeth no ſuch power of making lawes to be due to the Claſſes, unleſſe they can produce ſome other texts, which when they ſhall be alledged, ſhall be further examined, if God permit.</hi> ANSVV. I. All that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Davenp. hath here ſet downe is wholy impertinent, and all being granted, our aſſertion touching the lawfull authority of Synods &amp; Claſſes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth firme. We grant with Iunius,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adv. in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro. 4. l. 1. c. 18. § 11.</note> that the Apoſtles alone did not judge, but the Elder and others alſo concurred with them, not onely in counſell, but in giving judiciall ſentence with them. We grant that there is not the like reſpect to be had to the determinations of others, as of the Apoſtles: we grant that <hi>no ſuch power</hi> of making lawes is due to Claſſes, that is, <hi>no ſuch</hi> power of infallible determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. and yet we hold they have a lawfull authority of judging and deciding controverſies, &amp;c. The like we hold concerning particular Churches with their Elderſhips; we grant they have <hi>no ſuch</hi> power of infallible determinations, and yet a lawfull power to determine and judge of cauſes: We grant that there is not the like reſpect to be had to the determinations of particular Churches, as of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and yet a due reſpect not onely for admonition and counſell, but alſo for power to cenſure and to give ſentence. We grant that the cenſures, ſentences and judgements as well of Elderſhips and Churches, as of Synods and Claſſes, are in like manner to be tryed and examined by the Scriptures, and yet this grant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacheth not the lawfull authority of either of them, in exerciſing a power of judgement. II. For the better direction how to diſcerne &amp; judge of the actions of the Apoſtles, and how farre their example is a rule of practiſe and imitation to the Church of God, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſet downe a profitable and uſefull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction obſerved by Iunius,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. lib. 2. c. 16. n. 6.</note> which is, that <hi>the Apoſtles had a twofold manner of Power, Common and Proper. The Common is that ordinary power which they had together with the Elders, as they were Biſhops. The Proper or peculiar is that extraordinary povver which was for a while given unto the Evangelicall Church at the ſpringing up thereof, in reſpect of which the Apoſtles were above the whole Church. According to that common power, Peter was</hi>

In both theſe is a ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall authority over particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches: in reſpect of both there appeareth a mutuall dependence of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; that all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is not limited unto a particular Church, which is the Queſtion betwixt us.</p>

When I rayſe ſuch a doctrine from Act. 15. as he mentions, which I have not done any where, then is it time for me to manifeſt how the ſame ariſeth naturally from the Text. Election of Miniſters is an action belonging to ſeverall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and not to Claſſes and Synods: but if any particular Churches doe offend in chooſing unlawfull and unfit perſons, then are Claſſes and Synods to judge thereof, and to hinder ſuch elections.

II. Though Paul and Barnabas went up for ſuch ends as are here propounded, <hi>for countenancing of the trueth, &amp;c.</hi> yet thoſe ends doe not argue that therefore the Synod at Ieruſalem did not exerciſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authority in giving definitive ſentence touching the controverſy brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; ſeeing thoſe ends were more effectually and fully obtained thereby. for by ſuch judiciall ſentence the truth was countenanced before men, and the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of deceyvers more effectually ſtopped, and ſuſpicion of difference betwixt the Apoſtles more clearly taken away. III. Though Paul and Barnabas went not up <hi>to ſubmit their judgement to the judgement of the Apoſtles;</hi> yet this hinders not their going to procure that the judgement of thoſe deceyvers, which had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Church of Antioch, and likewiſe that the judgement of ſuch as had bene made to doubt by them might be ſubmitted unto the judgement of the Apoſtles, or that thoſe deceyvers might be cenſured by the Synod, if after conviction they ſhould perſiſt in their evill.

Had he had a very ſmall meaſure of knowledge in the Geographicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the holy Land and the countries bordering thereupon, without the knowledge whereof men cannot well underſtand the ſtory of the Bible, there being ſo many references which the H.

Let others be admoniſhed hereby, that they raſhly follow not ſuch a guide, that will be a great maſter and teacher of the Churches, and yet as the wiſe man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, knowes not the way to the City. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.15. III. I doe willingly grant that Antioch was 200 miles from Ieruſalem: thoſe 70 Dutch miles which this Authour mentions, according to common account make 280 Engliſh miles, 80 more then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne reckons.

The greater paines they tooke in travell, to come unto another ſuperiour judicatory out of themſelves, doth argue the greater neceſſity of Synods, and ſhewes that the fruit expected thereby was the more precious in their eyes. The Deputies of the Churches that came to the late Synod at Dort, from Geneva, Zurich and Berne, travelled further then theſe Antiochians did. And of old time they came more then twiſe ſo farre unto Synods. Had this combination of Churches and their authority in judging brought the Churches into <hi>Antichriſtian bondage,</hi> as the Browniſts call it,<note place="margin">See before Pag. 32.</note> then might it have bene ſayd unto all theſe travellers, as once unto the Idolatrous Jewes, <hi>O ye ſwift dromedaries, &amp;c. keep your feet from barenes and your thoat from thirſt.

                  <hi>I pray how can you prove that the Officers of theſe two Churches, being</hi> 200 <hi>miles aſunder, were combined and met ordinarily together (as the Claſſes doe) to determine the caſes of many Churches?</hi> ANSVV. I. Their combination is manifeſt in this act of communion and comming together for the judgement and deciſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy raiſed among them. II. That they met ordinarily together I never ſayd, neither doe I affirme it; this being not a Claſſicall but a Synodall Aſſembly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common diſtinction thereof, and according to the practiſe among us. III. That they determined the caſes of many Churches I ſhewed<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> before, from <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.4.</p>
               <p>I. CAN. <hi>Orhow doe you prove that there was any officer at all of Antioch, in Ieruſalem at this time?</hi> ANSVV. I prove it, I. Becauſe Paul and Barnabas were both ſpeciall Deputies of the Church of Antioch, and likewiſe had ſuch a generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as made them Officers of every Church. II. Becauſe the Apoſtles which then remained at Ieruſalem, as Peter and Iames, were as well Officers of Antioch as of Ieruſalem, Apoſtles being Governours of all Churches. III. For the other meſſengers ſent from Antioch, ſeeing Elders are approved by the Church as ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to mannage the affaires thereof, therefore it was reaſonable that at leaſt ſome of them ſhould be ſent about this buſines, &amp; thereupon <hi>Iunius</hi> (as is<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 68.</note> before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) takes it for granted, that the Elders of the Church of Antioch were among thoſe that judged in this Synod.</p>
               <p>I. CAN. <hi>Briefly, or how doe you proove, that the brethren ſent from Antioch exerciſed authority in the Church at Ieruſalem?</hi> ANSVV. That the Deputies ſent from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, had authority and power of ſuffrages in the Synod at Ieruſalem, appeareth by the generall and ſpeciall commiſſions given unto them, as is mentioned in the anſwer to his former demand. As Paul once anſwered for himſelf and for Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas upon another occaſion, when he was carped at by ſome in the Church of Corinth: <hi>Or I onely and Barnabas have we not power, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. ſo might he have anſwered for both in this caſe for let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. ſhew if he can what publick Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall meeting could have bene in thoſe times, in any Church, touching any controverſy that concerned any generall doctrine of the Goſpell, yea or the cenſure of manners in any other perſon, wherein Paul and Barnabas might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe authority with others.</p>
               <p>I. CAN. <hi>Yet all this you muſt make good, otherwiſe you are guilty of abuſing and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scripture, in affirming that</hi> the power which the Claſſis exerciſeth, was prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at Antioch and Ieruſalem, and by Apoſtolicall direction. <hi>This you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but it is untrue. &amp;c.</hi> ANSVV. I. Suppoſe I had not made good all that he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:112189:55"/>required me to proove; ſuppoſe the Church of Ieruſalem alone had judged the controverſy, and that no Officer of the Church of Antioch had bene among them, with any authority: yet this example of one Church judging the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy riſen in another, doth ſhew that all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is not limited unto a particular Church within itſelf, but that the cauſes of one Church may be ſubmitted unto the judgement of another. This is the ſubſtance of the Queſtion betwixt us, and this being granted it followes that Churches have liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Claſſes and Synods for the mutuall judging of their cauſes, as occaſion ſhall require. II. By charging me with untrueth in ſuch manner as here he doeth, he makes himſelf guilty of double untrueth: for 1. This affirmation here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was not mine at that time, but his in whoſe name I repeated it, and that with condition, if it were ſo, <hi>If the Churches here doe practiſe, &amp;c.</hi> as may be plainly ſeen in the forementioned place of my Anſwer. 2. Though at that time I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to diſpute the cauſe, but firſt waited for the proofes of ſuch as accuſed me; yet had I then uſed ſuch an affirmation, yet it had bene true, as I ſhew through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chapter, and therefore it was an untrueth in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne to avouch the contrary. And as for that place <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.31. which he miſapplyeth againſt me, the threatning contained therein is to be feared of him who hereafter abuſeth &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth ſo many Scriptures for the ſubverting of Synods.</p>
               <p>I. CAN.

The errour of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and the Papiſts is<note n="(c)" place="margin">De Con. cil. l. 1. c. 15. &amp; 16.</note> that onely <hi>Majores Praelati,</hi> the greater ſort of Prelates (ſuch as are their Biſhops and Archbiſhops, and by priviledge or cuſtome, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Abbots, and Generals of Orders) have <hi>jus ſuffragii deciſivi,</hi> that is, <hi>authority to give definitive ſentence;</hi> that Preſbyters, Elders, and other Doctours or learned men in the Synod have onely <hi>ſuffragium conſultivum, a voyce in conſultation,</hi> liberty to give counſell, to deliberate and diſpute, but not to give definitive ſentence in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of any matter. Thus they take away the right and power of judging from one half or more of thoſe perſons that are to appeare in Synods. The errour of the Browniſts and other our Oppoſites is that all the perſons in the Synod have onely <hi>ſuffragium conſultivum,</hi> onely power to deliberate, to adviſe and give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:112189:56"/>that all juriſdiction is limited unto a particular Church: and ſo they deſtroy wholly the authority of Synods, which the Papiſts doe in part.

Are they any <hi>other</hi> then all the knowne Reformed and Orthodox Churches in Europe? He might well think that if he had mentioned theſe, the very naming of them and my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of their practiſe, would have bene not ſo great a blame unto me, as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of making himſelf ſuſpected and condemned for his unjuſt oppoſing of them. That it may the better appeare how unjuſtly he blameth our practiſe, let us examine more particularly what he hath ſayd, and withall ſet downe ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, whereby the peoples right in Synods may the better be diſcerned.</p>

It may be indeed that the diſputation was before the people,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:112189:56"/>but leſt any man ſhould think that the common people were promiſcuouſly admitted to handle the cauſe. Luke expreſſely nameth the Apoſtles and Elders, as more ſit to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. We grant that beſides Miniſters and Elders, other members of the Church may have ſuffrages or voyces, and give ſentence in Synods as well as thoſe that are Officers; alwayes provided, that they be lawfully deputed and ſent thereunto. Thus <hi>D. Whitaker</hi> explaines himſelf touching his allowance of lay-men to have voyces in Synods, and ſayth,<note n="(l)" place="margin">De Conc. qu. 3. c. 2. p. 92.</note>

                  <hi>Not onely Biſhops are to be choſen of the Church to be ſent unto Synods, but other godly, prudent, &amp; learned men, which happily can diſpute more ſkilfully, and inquire into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies better then the Biſhops.

And this alſo is the practiſe of the Reformed Churches in theſe parts, where upon occaſion divers times ſome ſuch are deputed and ſent unto Synods, which have no Eccleſiaſticall office: and even in the Nationall Synod at Dort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other members of the Church, which were neither Miniſters nor Elders, were ſent thither &amp; allowed to be Delegates, &amp; were to have not onely delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but alſo definitive voyces, as well as any other; as appeares<note n="(p)" place="margin">Act.

Even of thoſe which by a lawfull election &amp; deputation are ſent unto Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, whether they be Miniſters and Elders, or other members of the Church, there ought to be a limited and certaine number: for if every Church in a whole nation might ſend as many as they would or could; there might be thouſands and ten thouſands gathered together into ſome Synods, whereby great confuſion and diſorder in the diſcuſſing and judging of many cauſes would apparently follow. D. Whitaker ſaith,<note n="(q)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. q. 3. p. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>Certainly confuſion cannot be avoyded, when too many meet together:</hi> And as for that Synod at Ieruſalem, he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. q. 1. c. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That aſſembly could not be great, becauſe they were compaſsed about with the Prieſts and Phariſees.</hi> And therefore alſo in the practiſe of theſe Churches there is a certaine number determined, of ſuch as are to be ſent unto Synods, as appeareth likewiſe in<note n="(r)" place="margin">Act.

               <p n="4">IV. We doe further grant this liberty, even unto ſuch as are no Delegates or Deputies of the Church, that though they be not allowed for judges, yet many of them<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Inn.

This alſo is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of theſe Churches, both in Provinciall and Nationall Synods, ſo farre as the place will conveniently receive a competent number: and ſo alſo it was obſerved in the Nationall Synod at Dort.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This liberty of hearing in Synods is ſo moderated &amp; reſtrained, that though they which have no calling unto the Synod, may heare queſtions touching doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Touching the right and liberty of Synods there are many other things to be further obſerved. When <hi>Mr Cartwright</hi> had ſpoken very much for the liberty of the people in Synods, yet for prevention of miſtaking, and by way of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf after a ſort he ſaith,<note n="(v)" place="margin">Confut. of the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Ann. on Act. 15.

For they (we mean Biſhops and Elders) may firſt by a ſeverall and foreſet deliberation, take counſell whether it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to propound any ſuch matter, as is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſie in that Councell where the people ſhall be preſent. Whereby if they perceive any generall and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate oppoſition of them againſt the truth, they may hold that poynt of doctrine back. This we ſee to have been done by <hi>Ioſias,</hi> who or ever he aſſembled the people, firſt of all aſſembled the Elders of Iuda and Ieruſalem. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23.1. Alſo by <hi>Iames,</hi> who at <hi>Pauls</hi> arrivall to Ieruſalem, firſt aſſembled the Elders to debate of the matter, or ever he was preſented before the Church. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18, 19. Secondly, if the people ſhould bewray a wilfull ſtubborneſſe againſt the truth, not ſuſpected by them: yet the Governours being ſound (without whom there can nothing be concluded) there ſhould not follow any prejudice of the Councels authority againſt the trueth: albeit the number of the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled were greater then of thoſe Biſhops and Elders. Hereupon it commeth that the Decrees of the Councell are after called the Decrees of the Apoſtles &amp; Elders: leaving out the brethren, which <hi>Luke</hi> had firſt ſet downe. And upon the ſame ground in the deciſion of doubtfull matters, <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 17. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that they ſhould have recourſe unto the <hi>Prieſts of the Leviticall ſtocke,</hi> for that they bare the principall ſway in thoſe deliberations. Laſtly, the caſe of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels being as it hath bene declared, it is no marvell although <hi>Auguſtine</hi> call a Generall Councell in ſome reſpect, <hi>the conſent of the whole Church,</hi> conſidering that not onely thoſe Biſhops and Elders, but ſome of the people were (in all likelyhood) there aſſembled.</q>

               <p>That which <hi>Mr Cartw.</hi> ſayth of the <hi>ſeverall and foreſet deliberation,</hi> agreeth with that which <hi>Beza</hi>

                  <hi>without their counſell, and without conſent of the people;</hi> Bucerus explaineth his ſpeech diſtinctly, on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note n="(a)" place="margin">Diſſent. de Gub. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. p. 145.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, firſt he mentions the counſell which was to be borrowed from the Preſbytery: and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conſent, whereby the judgement of the Preſbytery was publickly approved of the people.</hi> And this he applyes alſo to the order of that judgement deſcribed, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>

               <p>I. CAN. V. <hi>Howſoever the Church at Antioch, ſent ſome Brethren, with Paul and Barnabas, unto the Church at Ieruſalem: notwithſtanding (and let it be well obſerved) they did not this as being</hi> a dependent body, and ſtanding under another Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of themſelves. <hi>For as</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker<note n="(b)" place="margin">Poli.

                  <hi>excellently proves it, the Church at Antioch at this time, had abſolute power in, and for her ſelf, to have ended the controverſy; and might have done it: I ſay, in reſpect of authority, without acquainting therewith any other Congregation at all. To the ſame purpoſe another ſaith,</hi>

Conc. qu. 1. c. 1.</note> The Church of Antioch ſent not to Ieruſalem, as being bound in duety thereto: But in regard it was the chief place of Religion, therefore they made choyſe freely of that Congregation, as knowing them to be beſt able to reſolve the controverſie. <hi>True it is, the</hi> Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie<note n="(d)" place="margin">D.

                  <hi>deny this: of whoſe opinion</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Paget <hi>muſt either be; or els the Claſſes, (as they now rule) muſt fall to the ground; for any relief that this Scripture, Act.</hi> 15. <hi>will yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi> ANSVV. 1. Had M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne well underſtood the ſtate of the queſtion, or what he ſaith and whereof he affirmes, he might eaſily have knowne that we are of the ſame minde with <hi>Mr Parker,</hi> in this, that as Antioch ſo every other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church hath like authority to end their owne controverſies, if they finde themſelves able. This condition, concealed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, is foure or five times repeated by <hi>Mr Parker</hi> in the<note n="(e)" place="margin">Pol. Ecc. l. 3. c. 20. p. 301, 302.</note> place alledged, ſpeaking of Antioch and other particular Churches with theſe expreſſe words, <hi>ſi modo poſſit, ſi modo vires ſuppeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſent, &amp;c. if they could; if they had ability; if they found not themſelves too weak; in caſe of impotency, &amp;c.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne hiding theſe conditions from the eyes of his Readers, doth hereby hood-wink them and keeps them in darknes from ſeeing the right meaning of <hi>Mr Parker.</hi> 11. Beſides the caſe of impotency alledged by <hi>Mr Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> there was another reaſon why this controverſy at Antioch was to be brought unto a Synod, viz. becauſe it was <hi>cauſa communis,</hi> a common cauſe, that concerned both many other Churches in regard of the matter, and in ſpeciall the Church of Ieruſalem, becauſe the authours of this controverſy were not members of the Church of Antioch, but came from Iudaea and from them of Ieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 24. and therefore that Church of Ieruſalem had more right and authority to judge of them, then they of Antioch had. 111. Whereas he would have it to be well obſerved, that the Church of Antioch ſent to them of Ieruſalem, <hi>not as being a dependent body, ſtanding under another Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves:</hi> the right and well obſerving hereof ſtands in this, that we acknowledge particular Churches to be dependent bodies, not by way of ſubjection unto any one ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have more authority then the reſt, but ſo dependent that every one is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mutually ſubject to one another, as occaſion requireth. The Churches of Ieruſalem, of Antioch, of Samaria, and others, were all of equall authority, and yet each ſtanding under the authority of a Synod compounded of them all: and this appeareth by the inſtance of this controverſy, referred here to the deciſion of the Synod at Ieruſalem. IV. For the teſtimony of <hi>D. Whitaker,</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Conc. qu. 1. c. 1.</note> that <hi>the Church of Antioch ſent not to Ieruſalem as being bound in duety thereto:</hi> 1. It is miſalledged by him, for in the Chapter mentioned by him there are no ſuch words to be found:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:112189:58"/>the words are indeed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parkers, and not of <hi>another</hi> as he ſayth, poynting at D. Whit. in his margine. He jumbles teſtimonies together; that which one ſayth, he ſets downe in anothers name, and followes the miſtake that is in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parkers<note n="(g)" place="margin">Pa. 314.</note> book through the Printers or Writers fault. And though in the<note n="(h)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. Qu. 1. c. 2. p. 6.</note> Chapter following D. Whit. ſayth of Ieruſalem, that there was <hi>as it were a certaine caſtle of Religion and the head of the Church;</hi> yet the other words are none of his. So licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and negligent is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. in his quotations. 2. For the thing it ſelf, though in the combination of Churches into Synods, they are not limited and ſimply bound in duety (<hi>ex obligato,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker ſayth) to any one Church more then another, yet this freeth them not from their duety of uniting themſelves to ſome Claſſes or Synods: even as particular perſons though they be not ſimply bound to one Congregation more then another, but may uſe a Chriſtian liberty therein; yet are they bound in duety to joyne themſelves as members to ſome Chuch: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where no abſolute neceſſity is impoſed, yet godly wiſedome teacheth men a duety in reſpect of circumſtances and accidentall occaſions, to make choyſe of one Church rather then another. V. He alledgeth D. Whitg. ſo defectively that no man by his quotation can tell how to finde his words. But whereas he ſayth of the Hierarchy, that I muſt either be of their opinion; <hi>or els the Claſſes (as they now rule) muſt fall to the ground; for any relief, &amp;c.</hi> this conſequence remaines to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and proved by him.</p>

That <hi>the particular acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in caſes alike, muſt alike be obſerved,</hi> I doe willingly grant, and thereupon ground our Argument for the authority of Synods. To this end it is alledged of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in this very place which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. doth cite, viz. to ſhew how controverſies are to be brought from particular Churches, not to one perſon, to a Biſhop or Arch-Biſhop, as the Hierachy would have it, but unto a Synod according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. How M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne doth imagine that this ſhould be effectuall againſt Claſſes, he neither declareth, neither can I conjecture. II. Whereas he addeth, that <hi>the matter carried from Antioch to Ieruſalem was agreed upon by the whole Church, &amp;c.</hi> I argue thence; if a whole Church ſometime be ſo offended and troubled by falſe teachers, that they hold it needfull to ſeek help of a Synod; it is leſſe marvell that ſometimes one or two ſhould be driven to ſeek ſuch help. Had there bene but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:112189:58"/>one perſon in Antioch troubled and unſatiſfyed in conſcience about that poynt of juſtification and ſalvation by the works of the Law, who could have forbidden him to ſeek help of the Synod, either by way of counſell or judgement, when he could not finde it at home? And in matters of judgement, ſeeing juſtice is to be done to one perſon as well as to a multitude; <hi>Ier.</hi> 21.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.3. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.6. <hi>Amos,</hi> 5.12.24. therefore if one perſon think himſelf oppreſſed by a particular Church, the liberty of appeale is not to be denyed him. III. Whereas they ſay, <hi>Hence our Divines teach, &amp;c.</hi> whom do they meane by this phraſe, <hi>our Divines?</hi> Doth W. B. mean the Arminian Divines, unto whom he hath declined, and is become one of their diſciples? Doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. mean the Divines of the Separation? The communion of other Divines is renounced by them. And theſe alſo are ſuch, that if a whole Church together ſhould agree to referre their controverſies unto the judgement of a Synod, they hold it to be an Antichriſtian bondage. Doe they mean <hi>Mr Parker</hi> whom they alledged immediately before, and unto whom they ſeem to have reference by that ambiguous quotation, ſo ſet downe in the margine as if it belonged unto that which went before? Yet he is but one, and none of theirs. <hi>Mr Parker</hi> ſaith indeed<note n="*" place="margin">Pol. Eccl. p. 338.</note> there, that <hi>this delegation and power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legating is not in one Biſhop, but in the Churches themſelves.</hi> He ſpeakes of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Churches, when ſome deale with others concerning any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call buſines, by ſending their delegates or meſſengers unto them, which power of ſending delegates in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, he proves to be in the Church it ſelf, and not in any one Biſhop, in oppoſition unto the Hierarchy, who will have ſuch buſineſſes to be done by themſelves and in their owne name. That which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker ſayth is no way contrary unto the practiſe of the Claſſes and Synods, where the Deputies and Delegates of the Churches appeare in the name of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches from which they are ſent, acknowledging the power of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation to be derived unto them from the ſame. Mr C. and W. B. confound theſe two things which are to be diſtinguiſhed, viz. the dealing in Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in the name of the Church, which they onely are allowed to doe who are choſen of the Church and deſigned thereunto, and the propounding of perſonall grievances in caſe of appeale or complaint touching any thing that is amiſſe, which, as we ſayd before, is free unto every Officer and member of the Church when he cannot otherwiſe be ſatiſfyed, he doing it ſtill in his owne name. Now both theſe may be underſtood by that their phraſe of <hi>bringing things from one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to another:</hi> whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker meant onely the former, as is plaine by his whole diſcourſe in the place mentioned; though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. and W.

The Argument is not taken from the infallibility of trueth that was in the decrees of this Synod, but from the order according to which they were made, and the perſons determining the things that were then and there conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being ſuch as did not all belong unto that particular Congregation, where the controverſy was rayſed. II. Though the decrees in that Synod were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Scriptures, as I granted<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> before; yet they could not be ſayd to be divine Scripture, untill they were by <hi>Luke</hi> recorded among the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> neither was it manifeſt unto all that they were according to the Scriptures, untill it was concluded in the Synod; for els it had bene in vaine to have repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for this reſolution.

It is true indeed that the decrees of this Synod were directed and delivered unto ſeverall Churches of the Gentiles, where the obſervation of them was judged to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not onely becauſe they were <hi>by infallible direction from the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which reaſon is implyed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robinſon (from whence this and the ſubſtance of moſt of the former exceptions is borrowed) when he addes,<note n="(k)" place="margin">Iuſtif. of Sep. p. 199.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo impoſed upon all other Churches, &amp;c.</hi> but beſides, becauſe the Apoſtles were chief judges in this Synod, who as I have ſhewed often<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 62, 72.</note> before, were as Delegates from all the Churches; in which reſpect, as was alſo noted<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cartwright, this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod may be accounted a Generall Councell.</p>

                     <hi>It is to be noted that he ſaith</hi> [I denounce or I charge] <hi>he doth not ſay</hi> [I exhort or give counſell] <hi>leaving it to the liberty of Timothie,</hi> And thus here we are in like manner to underſtand him, when he tells how a Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of Miniſters and Elders were ſharply and ſeverely to <hi>charge</hi> a Church, that they uſed an authority more then of exhorting or admoniſhing and counſelling, ſo that the matter was not left in the liberty of them that were ſo charged.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. He proceeds further, and after both admonition and a ſevere charge or prohibition, he ſhewes that the Claſſis hath yet more to doe in this buſines, if their charge be not regarded, in reſpect of the unlawfull election, viz. <hi>that they confirme it not by ſuffering him to exerciſe any miniſtery.</hi> Whereas ordinarily Miniſters newly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected are confirmed and ordained by impoſition of hands by ſome Miniſters of the Churches neere unto them; this <hi>Mr Cartwr.</hi> would have to be denyed unto him. And this denyall of his ordination after his election, is to be eſteemed a kinde of cenſure, in ſome ſort proportionable to the depoſition of a Miniſter already confirmed; ſeeing keeping out or caſting out from the Miniſtery, are actions of like nature. And this is that which <hi>Mr Fenner,</hi> who was well acquainted with the meaning of <hi>Mr Cartwr.</hi> in theſe things, poynteth at, when ſpeaking of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy riſing in a Church about the calling of a Miniſter, he ſaith;<note n="(f)" place="margin">S.

                     <hi>That from the admonition of the Churches, it is meet to come to Synods, if the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches be contemned; may be ſhewed by proportion from the place of our Saviour Chriſt in S. Matthew, ch.</hi> 18. <hi>for as when one brother is not mooved with the admonition of two or three, the matter muſt be referred unto the Church, to ſee whether the majeſtie of it will moove him, whom the authority of two or three would not: even ſo it is meet that the Church, that maketh light of the judgement of two or three Churches, ſhould be preſsed with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Dioceſſe or Province, as ſhall be in that behalf adviſed.</hi> From this proportion, ſeeing the rule, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. was not onely a rule of admonition, but alſo a rule for the exerciſe of authority in cenſuring, it followes hence in like manner, that many Churches combined in a Synod, have power to cenſure as well as to admoniſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Mr Cartwr.</hi> doth further declare his meaning in the ſame place, when he alledgeth the example of the Reformed Churches in this matter: <hi>If I were in this poynt</hi> (ſaith<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 232.</note> he) <hi>deſtitute of the word of God: yet the naked examples of the Reformed Churches ought to weigh downe a Popiſh cuſtome.</hi> Now it is undenyable, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches doe allow the uſe of Claſſes and Synods, not onely for counſell or admonition, but alſo for the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall authority and juriſdiction in judging of cauſes &amp; cenſuring of offendours.</p>

Now ſeeing he derives their offices from that forme of government, which is confeſſed not to have bene a ſingle, uncompounded policie; this is an evidence, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did not hold juriſdiction to be limited unto a particular Church. V. He omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. writes in diſtinguiſhing the Preſbytery or Elderſhip of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 281.</note> into <hi>a Synod or a Generall Councill.</hi> And not to ſpeak of other things, he omitteth that deſcription of a Generall or <hi>Vniverſall Councill,</hi> viz. that it is <hi>a Preſbyterie conſiſting of the deputies of many Synods, to determine and compound thoſe things that may be profitable for the whole Church or for the greateſt part thereof.</hi> The word which he uſeth to expreſſe the authority exerciſed therein, when he ſaith, <hi>ad ea ſtatuenda,</hi> t.i. <hi>to determine, to make a ſtatute or decree,</hi> imports more then a bare admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or counſell: and therefore it is manifeſt from hence that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of this new Diſcipline, which denyes the authority of Synods.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. His unfaithfull tranſlation of <hi>Mr Fenner</hi> is alſo to be obſerved in divers points. I. When ſpeaking of the Elderſhip of one particular Church,<note n="(v)" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, p. 238.</note> he tells how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. ſaith, <hi>it is properly called</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The words of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. are, that it is<note n="(x)" place="margin">S. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol. l. 7. p. 279.</note> 
                     <hi>proprio nomine ſie dictum, ſo called with the proper name:</hi> His meaning is, that in common uſe of ſpeech it had the proper name given unto it; even as it comes to paſſe oft times that a part is called by the proper name of the whole, and one ſpecies or one ſort receives the proper name of the whole kinde, as when in ſpeaking commonly of the Miniſters and Elders of a Church, the ruling Elders are ſo called with a proper name that belongs to the whole kinde, ſeeing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word are Elders as well as they: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. ſo when the ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are called with the proper name of <hi>Governours,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. though Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word are governours alſo as well as they. And unleſſe we thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fen. there ſhould be no trueth in his words; for as he himſelf ſaith,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 245.</note> there is a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> in the name of Elders when it is given to Eccleſiaſticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: and therefore there muſt be a double improper or figurative ſpeech, a double Synecdoche, when the aſſembly of ſome Officers in a particular Church is called with the proper name of the Elderſhip, whereas but ſome of them are el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly or aged men, and whereas the aſſembly of ſuch men in a Synod is an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as well as the other. II. It is a notable falſification of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fenners teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when as he diſtinguiſhing the Eccleſiaſticall Elderſhip into the Elderſhip of a particular Church and into the Elderſhip of many Churches, and giving before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in the firſt place a generall definition of the Elderſhip, common to both thoſe kindes, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. comes and reſtraines that generall definition to one kinde, and brings in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. ſpeaking on this manner, <hi>The Elderſhip of the firſt ſort, he ſayth, is a compound office wherein all the Elders doe, in the name of the whole Church, adminiſter all the buſineſſes &amp;c.</hi> But this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. hath not ſayd: I deſire the Reader to look on the<note n="(z)" place="margin">S.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:112189:63"/>definition to the Elderſhip of many Churches, viz. to Claſſes and Synods, which he gives unto the Elderſhip of a particular Church, thereby the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and juriſdiction which he gives herein unto a particular Church is alſo given by him unto a Synod, the Elderſhip of many Churches: and then are not Synods for counſell onely or admonition, but they are to exerciſe a juriſdiction and power as well as particular Churches. III. Another inſtance of his unfaithfull tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be obſerved from thoſe words of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 278.</note> 
                     <hi>poſtea autem auditis &amp; aſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus, decernenda &amp; pro decretis Eccleſiis proponenda ſunt;</hi> which he tranſlates thus,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 239.</note> 
                     <hi>and afterwards, the opinions and aſſent of all being declared, matters are to be concluded.</hi> Thoſe laſt words ſhould have bene tranſlated thus; <hi>matters are to be decreed and to be propounded unto the Churches for decrees:</hi> and being thus tranſlated they import an act of authority, and a power of juriſdiction, in making decrees, which are more then counſell or admonition, eſpecially when thoſe matters ſo decreed are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto the Churches for decrees. But the word of <hi>concluding</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. uſeth is ambiguous, and is applyed ſometimes to the reaſonings of men, either in private or publick, where there is no authority to give definitive ſentence, or to make decrees for the Churches. <hi>Mr Canne</hi> himſelf, though he condemne the Claſſes and Synods of the Reformed Churches, yet doth he allow Miniſters and brethren of divers Churches to come together,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches plea, p. 95.</note> 
                     <hi>to conferre of things, yea and to conclude (if they can) what they judge meet &amp;c.</hi> This uſe of the word <hi>conclude</hi> ſerves to elude and fruſtrate this pregnant teſtimony of their power. IV. Another miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlation is, when in the ſame page, thoſe words of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. <hi>leges maximi momenti conſtituendae,</hi> are thus tranſlated by him, <hi>orders alſo of the greateſt moment to be made.</hi> This I doe therefore note the rather, becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. keeps ſo great a quoile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtrict difference betwixt orders and lawes, and ſaith<note n="(d)" place="margin">Apol. rep. p. 257. 258.</note> that <hi>orders &amp; lawes are ill confounded</hi> by me, and is large in declaring his minde therein. His friend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that made the Alphabeticall Table for him, and prefixed it before his book, notes this as a remarkable matter therein,<note n="*" place="margin">Letter L.</note> 
                     <hi>Lawes and orders differ.</hi> Now if theſe things be ſo, then hath he done very ill in confounding lawes and orders, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the word <hi>leges, orders,</hi> when he ſhould have tranſlated it <hi>lawes,</hi> according to the right and proper ſignification thereof. If he had diſliked M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. for uſing the word <hi>leges,</hi> or <hi>lawes,</hi> and would correct it by putting in the word <hi>orders;</hi> this was more then an exact and faithfull Tranſlatour might doe. He ſhould rather have tranſlated the word truely, according to the right ſignification, and then have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven warning to the Reader touching the fault of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fenner in the ill confounding of lawes and orders, and putting one for the other. After theſe unfaithfull omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and miſtranſlations, <hi>Mr Dav.</hi> hath not bene afraid to ſay confidently of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Thus have I faithfully tranſlated the words of this eminent light in his time, Mr Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Fenner, who was joyned with Mr Cartwright, &amp;c.</hi> To his commendation of him I doe willingly aſſent: he was indeed an <hi>eminent light:</hi> and why then hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. gone about to obſcure his light, by depraving his teſtimony, and labouring to put this bright-burning candle under a buſhell, that men ſhould not ſee his light? Whether he make ſtrongly for him or againſt me, let others judge.</p>

II. Though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. ſpeaking of excommunication and abſolution from it, ſayth that they are to be done in the aſſembly, <hi>by the authority of the whole Church,</hi> which laſt words M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. for ſpeciall obſervation cauſeth to be printed in great capitall letters; yet this doth not prove that he left <hi>the whole power of juriſdiction in the particular Church:</hi> ſeeing in the ſame<note n="(g)" place="margin">Pa. 277</note> place ſpeaking of Eccleſiaſticall judgements admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the Synod or Preſbytery in deciding of doubts, he ſaith alſo, <hi>etſi autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas communis ſit, miniſtris tamen &amp; ſententiam dicendi &amp; eam exponendi maxima facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da poteſtas:</hi> that is, <hi>though the authority be common, yet the greateſt power of giving ſentence and declaring it is to be yeelded unto the Miniſters.</hi> Therefore did he not leave the whole power of juriſdiction in a particular Church. III.

But theſe paſſages M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. omitted, when he tranſlated other parts of the ſame periods: He thought it not to be for his advantage to have his Reader take knowledge of them. IV.

V. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. in the ſame chapter,<note n="(i)" place="margin">Pag. 278 279.</note> ſhewes from the Scriptures that in theſe Preſbyteriall aſſemblies there ought to be a mutuall office performed in the ſame in ſpeciall manner towards one another, not onely for counſels, but alſo for the cenſures of ſuch as are members of thoſe aſſemblies.

After M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. had ſpoken in generall both of the Preſbytery of one and of many Churches joyntly together, then he comes to ſpeak of each of them ſeverally: and there againe ſpeaking of the Preſbytery of many Churches, that is, of Claſſes and Synods, he ſaith,<note n="(l)" place="margin">S.

Thus he wholy deſtroyeth that Democraty, or popular Anarchy, which Beza juſtly condemneth in Morellius, and is by ſome unjuſtly imputed to thoſe that plead for a due reformation of Churches, according to the rules of the word, and the primitive patternes.

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and promiſed touching <hi>Mr Parker</hi> and theſe other Writers, that he would <hi>ſhew them to be ſtrongly againſt me:</hi> but though he make a long diſcourſe of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and doe alledge in groſſe eleven chapters at once out of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker; yet doe I not finde that he applyes any thing to the queſtion againſt me. for I. Suppoſe it be granted (which yet ſome godly and learned men deny) that all power Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall is eſſentially and primarily in the Church, as the proper ſubject thereof, and from thence derived and communicated to other, either particular perſons, or aſſemblies of Claſſes and Synods; what is this to our queſtion? doth it follow from hence that Synods have no power to judge Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, or that they are onely for counſell or admonition? This is the poynt of our queſtion; but this neither <hi>Mr Parker</hi> affirmes, neither doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. offer to conclude it by any juſt conſequence from his words: and ſo all that he alledgeth is not to the purpoſe. II. This very derivation of power from particular Churches unto Claſſes and Synods, is an argument of the power of judgement that is in them: for what great need was there of a derivative power to conſult or to admoniſh onely? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. confeſſeth that<note n="(q)" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>every Chriſtian hath power of admonition in another for his good.</hi> And ſhall Synods have no more power then particular and private perſons? III. Whereas <hi>Mr Parker</hi> diſtinguiſheth betwixt <hi>the power</hi> of the Church and <hi>the exerciſe</hi> of that power, and acknowledgeth that the execution of this power in the adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments is not in the whole Church, but in ſome ſpeciall perſons appoynted thereunto; it followeth hence that in ſome things the Miniſters and Governours of a Church have a power which the Church cannot exerciſe without them; and therefore in ſome reſpect a greater authority then the whole Church beſide them. This is confeſſed in the practiſe of the Browniſts themſelves, who keep their children ſometimes unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed for many yeares together, while they want Miniſters that have authority to baptiſe. IV. The Authors alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, to ſhew that Eccleſiaſticall power is originally in the Church, did never draw any ſuch conſequence from thence, that therefore there is no power of juriſdiction in Synods, but made the contrary concluſion, that therefore there was a power of juriſdiction in them. And this concluſion was made, not onely by the <hi>Councell of Conſtance and Baſill,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:112189:65"/>Ioh. Gerſon &amp; Schola Pariſienſis,</hi> but by <hi>D.

For <hi>Mr Parker</hi> himſelf, though he be very large touching the originall power of particular Churches, and the derivation thereof unto Miniſters &amp; Synods; yet he never concludeth from hence a want of juriſdiction in Synods, but declares the contrary in many<note n="(t)" place="margin">Pol.

I. If thoſe 22 Arguments of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Park. be good and effectuall to prove the Churches ſuperiority over her Rulers; then have we ſo many ſound Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the authority of Claſſes and Synods. This is evident, becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. applyes thoſe 22 Arguments to prove the juriſdiction of Synods as well as of particular Churches. His affirmation is<note n="(v)" place="margin">Poli. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. l. 3. c. 12. p. 77.</note> that <hi>the ſuperiorit of juriſdiction is retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in every Church, ſo that neither the Paſtour in the Prime Church, nor the Praeſident in the Combined Church, nor yet any Biſhop is above the Church, but under the power of every Church.</hi> This diſtinction of the Church is more plainly declared by him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where he ſaith,<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 13. p. 117.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſt itaque viſibilis Eccleſia duplex, Prima et Orta, Prima, eſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio ſingulorum fidelium in unam Congregationem, et generali nomine Eccleſia dicitur.

The Combined Church is a collection of more prime Churches into one company, &amp; is called a Synod.</hi> Now the juriſdiction which he ſpeakes of, he makes common to both, and expreſſely applyes it to both, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined Church or Synod, as well as to the particular or prime Church. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in the 12. chapter he ſpake generally of both theſe kindes of Churches, he manifeſts in the firſt words of the 13. chapter, where he begins thus,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>

                  <p>I. DAV. <hi>And in cap.</hi> 18.13. <hi>making a compariſon between a particular Church, and Churches combined in Synods and Claſſes, he affirmeth that the difference between them is, not in the intenſive conſideration of their power (which the Congregation hath, in reference to the Keyes, within it ſelfe) but in the extenſive power onely, wherein the Synod hath a power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to more objects, viz. to many Churches (in things common) whereas the power of a particular Church is confined, and limited within its owne compaſſe.</hi> ANSVV. In this 13. chap. (for that number of 18. ſeemes to be miſtaken) <hi>Mr Parker</hi> doth againe give divers pregnant teſtimonies for the authority and juriſdiction of Synods. I. In the place alledged his words are theſe:<note n="(b)" place="margin">Pol. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. l. 2. c. 13. p. 121.</note> 
                     <hi>I diſtinguiſh touching the power of the keyes, which is intenſive or extenſive. No prime Church, no not the leaſt of them doth want the intenſive power; but it wants that extenſive which a Synod hath, ſeeing the power</hi> thereof <hi>is extended to many Churches; whereas the power of the prime</hi> or particular <hi>Church is not extended beyond her owne bounds.</hi> The power of the keyes is a power of juriſdiction, an Eccleſiaſticall power of binding and looſing; whether intenſive or extenſive: this power he confeſſeth to be in a Synod; and therefore the uſe of Synods is not onely for counſell or admonition, but for juriſdiction alſo in the judgement of cauſes. Whereas according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. his allegation, the difference betwixt the power of a particular Church and of a Synod is <hi>in the extenſive power onely;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Synod is alſo of greater power and juriſdiction in extenſion unto many Churches. II. In comparing the power of a particular Church with a Synod, he ſayth expreſſely,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 129.</note> 
                     <hi>Major quidem poteſtas eſt Synodi, quam unius alicujus Eccleſiae primae &amp; parochialis. Greater is the power of a Synod, then of any one prime or pariſhionall Church.</hi> But if Synods could onely counſell and admoniſh, &amp; a particular Church beſides that, could cenſure and uſe Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, then ſhould a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church have greater power then a Synod: and not onely greater intenſive power, but as great extenſive; ſeeing a particular Church, yea or a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may give counſell or admonition, either to a Synod, or to many Churches, as occaſion ſhall require. It is true indeed which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. ſaith, that <hi>all the pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Churches</hi> are greater then their Synods, ſeeing by a new Synod they may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate that which was ordained amiſſe by their Deputies, without their conſent, ſentence and will. This he proves by many arguments, and this we willingly conſent unto; this is the practiſe of all the Reformed Churches. But this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the queſtion in hand, that a Synod hath the power of the keyes, and juriſdiction, and greater authority then any one Church. III. This is another concluſion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parkers.<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 120.</note> 
                     <hi>We ſay there is one forme of government inſtituted of Chriſt in all Churches, both prime and combined: ſo that we may not dreame there is in the prime Church a different forme from that which is in the combined Church: neither may we imagine that in the combined Church there is another different from that by which the prime Church is governed.</hi> If this aſſertion be true, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. and thoſe of his minde do dreame, when they imagine ſo different a forme of government to be inſtituted in the particular Churches and Synods, which he calles the combined Churches,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:112189:66"/>that one ſort of them ſhould onely give counſell &amp; admonition, &amp; the other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction &amp; cenſure.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt limitation is</hi> ad rem propriam, unto their proper buſineſſe, <hi>for in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter the Synod is chief, that is, the authority of Churches joyntly gathered together, is the chiefeſt.</hi> Hence it is confeſſed that Synods have power of juriſdiction over Churches: for 1. In judging theſe common cauſes particular Churches, though differing one from an other are overſwayed by the moſt voyces; and each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is ſubject to the ſentence of the Synod. 2. Let any Scripture be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. to ſhew the ſummity or ſoveraignty of Synods in theſe common cauſes, and he ſhall finde thereby the uſe of Synods proved to be for juriſdiction in one Eccleſiaſticall cauſe as well as in another being lawfully brought unto them. for, what reaſon is there, why the counſell and admonition of a Synod, may not ſuffice for the help of particular Churches in a common controverſy as well as in other ſpeciall buſineſſes, leaving the ſentence and deciſion unto the prime Churches?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond limitation is alſo in a proper buſineſſe; to wit</hi> ad caſum ſufficient is poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, in the caſe of ſufficient ability: <hi>for if any Church be found unable to end their owne buſineſse: vvho doubts but that it is bound to require the help of fellow-Churches?</hi> In this caſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. acknowledgeth the ſuperiority or ſoveraignty of power and authority
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:112189:66"/>in Synods: but if Synods were onely for counſell &amp; admonition, what needed a ſupremacy of power; ſeeing inferiours may give counſell unto their ſuperiours, &amp; admoniſh them alſo of their duety? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. ſhewes well that in caſe of impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or weaknes, the Church of Antioch ſent to Ieruſalem, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. But this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. ſeeks to pervert by his gloſſe, when he ſaith, they ſent to Ieruſalem <hi>for the help of their counſell,</hi> as though they did not as well deſire help by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſentence in determining the controverſy. If counſell onely had bene ſought, why did not the Synod at Ieruſalem content themſelves to give counſell and adviſe? why did they alſo make a decree, and this not onely by authority of the Apoſtles, but alſo by common authority of Elders and others that were in the Synod? <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third limitation is in a proper buſines, and ability alſo, to wit in the caſe of</hi> right and lawfull adminiſtration. <hi>for vve are to think the ſame of the Church, as of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour of the Church: now vve have ſhewed before out of Gerſon, touching the rectour, that he in caſe of right adminiſtration is ſubject to none, yet in caſe of aberration is ſubject: ſo the Church which in caſe of right adminiſtration is ſubject to none, yet in caſe of aberration doth now beginne to be ſubject. Even as therefore the Paſtour erring and offending is ſubject to no one of his fellowes, as to a Biſhop, but onely to many of his Church: ſo alſo the Church that erreth and offendeth is ſubject to no one Church, as to a Dioceſan, but to many aſsembled together in a lawfull Synod.</hi> Hence it is evident that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. aſſcribed unto Synods more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then a bare counſell or admonition onely: for 1. He often uſeth the word of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> which implyes an authority and juriſdiction in thoſe to whom in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their calling men be <hi>ſubject.</hi> This is paſſed by as unſeen or unregarded in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. his allegation. 2. He ſpeakes of being ſubject ſo as the Paſtour erring and offending is ſubject to many of the Church, that is to their juriſdiction and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 3. He ſpeakes of ſuch ſubjection as is diſtinguiſhed from receyving of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and admonition: otherwiſe it ſhould not be true which he ſayth of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Churches ſubjection; ſeeing every Paſtour erring and offending is bound to receyve counſell or admonition from any one of his fellowes; and the Church erring &amp; offending is bound to receyve counſell or admonition from any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, though it be not ſubject to the juriſdiction of any one in ſpeciall, but onely to many in a lawfull Synod.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth limitation is in caſe of right adminiſtration,</hi> when no evill adminiſtration is preſumed [or imagined.] <hi>for although the Church adminiſter aright, yet if any man thinking himſelf wronged, do appeale from it, the ſame is now become obnoxious [or ſubject unto the cenſure of] her fellowes and ſiſters, ſo that judgement may be given in a Synod touching her adminiſtration.</hi> That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> P. here alſo ſpeakes of ſubjection unto the juriſdiction of Synods, it is evident, while for the allowance of appeales he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the ſame place the teſtimonies of the Synod of Sardica, of the Univerſity of Paris, and of D.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:112189:67"/>page, <hi>We certainly finde Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>that cauſes are to be ended by the Synods of the Churches and not by one man, if any doe appeale from the judgement of his Church.</hi> Thus we ſee, 1. that he makes <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. a common ground for the juriſdiction of Synods, as well as of particular Churches. 2. The very phraſe of terminating or ending contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, ſhewes that he ſpake of juriſdiction; becauſe counſell alone is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to end controverſies, unleſſe there be authority and juriſdiction exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And further, whereas D. Bilſon had ſayd, that Synods have had more power then Elderſhips, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker aſſenteth, ſaying,<note n="(h)" place="margin">Pa. 303</note> 
                     <hi>So truely it ought to have bene done, that they ſhould onely have more: but this more ſerveth not your purpoſe, but contradicteth it: for if they have had onely more, it followeth that the Elderſhips alwayes ought to have had ſome power, though leſſe.</hi> Thus expreſſely he acknowledgeth a power of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Synods, as well as in Elderſhips: and many the like aſſertions (if need were) might further be noted out of the ſame chapter.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it appeares how vaine it is which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. ſaith, that in the 3 laſt limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions other Churches doe concurr, <hi>in way of counſell and declaration of their judgment,</hi> as if that were all they did; as if the Synod conſiſting of thoſe Churches did not give definitive ſentence of cauſes brought unto them. And hereby it may withall appeare, how the judgement of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker doth agree with the practiſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, which doe exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction in their Synods, according to thoſe 4 limitations ſpecifyed by him. There is no matter determined by them and judged in their Synods, but it may be reduced to one of theſe 4 heads; it is either a common cauſe, or a caſe of impotency, where there is need of help, or an unlawfull adminiſtration in ſome, or at leaſt a preſumption of evill dealing.</p>

In generall, it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:112189:67"/>is to be obſerved, 1. That the ſcope of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker in this chapter is to ſhew in what manner many Churches are combined together in Synods, namely as equals in a mutuall fellowſhip, and not with ſubjection to any one Church above the reſt. This he propounds in the beginning, as the ſtate of the queſtion; when he ſavth,<note n="(l)" place="margin">Pol. Eccl. lib. 3. c. 22. p. 327.</note> 
                     <hi>The Hierarchy will have this combination to be ſubordinate and joyned with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto their Hierarchy: againſt the common opinion of all Proteſtants, which affirme no conſociation to be lawfull, but that which is mutuall, ſuch as is wont to be among equalls.</hi> He thought not therefore of this new found out combination, by ſuch as maintaine the ſingle uncompounded policie, but of ſuch as is commonly received by <hi>all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> His arguments are all directed againſt the Popiſh and Hierarchicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, which we alſo diſallow with him. This he repeats againe for concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after his ſix arguments, ſaying,<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 336.</note> 
                     <hi>By all which it is plenteouſly demonſtrated, that the combination of Churches is not Hierarchicall, with ſubjection unto any one among the reſt, but rather Ariſtocraticall, wherein equalls are joyned together.</hi> Neither could he call the government of Churches by Synods, Ariſtocraticall, if they did onely direct by way of counſell; ſeeing an Ariſtocracy is ſuch a government as exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth juriſdiction in the judgement of cauſes. II. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parkers meaning had bene otherwiſe, viz. that Claſſicall and Synodall combinations had no authority nor juriſdiction, or that no Churches ought to be ſubject unto the ſame; then had all his 6 arguments bene of no force, neither could they proove any ſuch matter. We may ſee it plainly in the example of the prime or particular Churches, where in the combination of many members together, though the <hi>ground</hi> of it be love; though the <hi>forme</hi> of it be communion; though the <hi>matter</hi> of it be brethren, which are equall among themſelves; though the <hi>object</hi> of it be <hi>res communis,</hi> that which concerneth all in common; though the <hi>end</hi> of it be, not to receive the mandates of any one member, but the conſent of many: yet doth it not follow hence, but that ſuch a Church and ſociety hath power of cenſure and juriſdiction, and that the members thereof are to be ſubject unto ſuch a combination. And thus alſo may particular Churches ſubmit themſelves to many, combined together in a Synod. III. If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker did not meane thus, but ſimply denyed all juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Synods &amp; ſubjection of Churches unto them; then ſhould he be contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to himſelf, in that which he had ſo expreſſely and ſo often acknowledged in other places before: as that, <hi>Greater is the power of a Synod, then of any one prime or particular Church:</hi> and that <hi>the Church that erreth and offendeth is ſubject to no one Church as to a Dioceſan, but to many aſſembled together in a lawfull Synod.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:112189:68"/>without ſubjection, as it fell out in Cyprians time</hi> in cauſa lapſorum, <hi>in the cauſe of them that fell [in time of perſecution] which thereupon became publick, becauſe the offence was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in many Churches:</hi> Leſt any ſhould ſtumble at theſe his words, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that as perſonall cauſes and offences are by accident the object of Claſſicall and Synodall judgements; ſo by like kinde of accident they are the object of that judgement and juriſdiction which is exerciſed by particular Churches.

And further, for that which he repeats againe, that this combination of Churches by accident, is <hi>without ſubjection,</hi> it is ſtill to be remembred that his meaning is, without ſubjection <hi>to any one above the reſt:</hi> for ſo he againe largely explaines himſelf in the ſame place, giving inſtance in the Church of Carthage and in Cyprian the Biſhop thereof, maintayning againſt <hi>D.

Now if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker did judge this rare and high commendation to be due unto the Reformed Churches, and that by divine warrant, by the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt foretelling their eſtate and the purity of the Diſcipline obſerved by them; then was he not of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. his minde. for then he ſhould have judged them not to be a free people, while the cauſes of particular Congregations are judged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by another ſuperiour authority in Synods: Then ſhould he rather have judged that their Churches wanted the <hi>key of David,</hi> and were deprived of their lawfull and proper priviledges and prerogatives, being ſubject to an Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction in the aſſembly of the combined Churches. And in ſumme, then ſhould he (according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. his opinion) have judged them to carry a yoke of ſervitude and ſubjection, to be caſt off with all ſpeed, rather then a <hi>crowne</hi> of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberty, to be held faſt by them: then ſhould he with Mr <hi>Canne</hi>

                  <p>TO conclude, for the judgement of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker in this controverſy, there are few that did better know, or at leaſt had more meanes to know his minde, then I. The trueth is, when he came from Leyden, where he and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacob had ſojourned ſome while together, he profeſſed at his firſt comming to Amſterdam, that the uſe of Synods was for counſell and adviſe onely, but had not authority to give definitive ſentence in the judging of cauſes. But after much conference with him, when he had more ſeriouſly and ripely conſidered of this queſtion, he plainly changed his opinion, and profeſſed ſo much not onely unto me, but unto ſundry others upon occaſion; ſo that ſome of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacobs minde were offended with him, and expoſtulated not onely with him, but with me alſo, as being an occaſion of altering his judgment. I had meanes to underſtand his minde aright, and better then thoſe that doe ſo many wayes pervert his meaning, he being not onely a member of the ſame Church, but a member of the ſame family &amp; living under the ſame roofe with me; where we had continuall and daily occaſion to talk of theſe things, and at that time when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacob publiſhed his unſound wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings touching this queſtion. He being afterwards alſo a member of the ſame El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, and by office ſitting with us dayly to heate and judge the cauſes of our Church, and ſo becomming a member of our Claſſicall combination, yet did he never teſtify againſt the <hi>unduepower</hi> of the Claſſis, or complaine that we were not <hi>a free people,</hi> though the Claſſis exerciſed the ſame authority then, as now it doth. Yea he being alſo for that time the Scribe of our Conſiſtory, the Acts of our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip and Church being recorded with his owne hand, are extant to ſhew his agreement with us in the government of this Church. And it appeares hereby that he was of another ſpirit and judgement, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Davenp. who hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſo many vaine cavills againſt the government and diſcipline of theſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, and this under the cloake &amp; pretence of his agreement with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker. Yea and further it is apparent that the knowledge and experience which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker got by this his living here in communion with theſe Churches, hath

For through the inward familiarity which I had with him a long time, for more then 20 yeares together, while he lived in theſe countries, having oftentimes had earneſt conference with him touching this queſtion, and much complayning of the wrong done to many Miniſters by that booke entitled <hi>Engliſh Puritaniſme,</hi> which he had tranſlated into Latine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is ſuch a peremptory reſtraint of all Eccleſiaſticall authority unto particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations; though he did never plainely retract that which he publiſhed, yet he ſhewed himſelfe divers times enclining to a change of his judgement, yea &amp; ſometimes acknowledged that Synods had power to judge of cauſes, and by their ſentence to decree the excommunication of ſuch as had deſerved the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For his writings; D. Ames when he<note n="(t)" place="margin">Preface to Mr Par. book de Pol. Eccl. anno 1616.</note> gave ſo great approbation of Mr Parkers work which he wrote of Eccleſiaſticall policie, wherein he doth ſo largely maintaine the power of Claſſes and Synods, might cauſe the Readers to think that he was of the ſame judgement with him, ſeeing he gives ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall allowance and commendation thereof, without any exception about this queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is to be obſerved that in none of his latter writings he doth uſe that peremptory phraſe, in limiting Synods, or Churches combined in Claſſes or Synods, <hi>onely to counſell or adviſe,</hi> in ſuch manner as was done in that<note n="(v)" place="margin">Engl. Purit. c. 2.</note> firſt writing.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And more particularly, in his Treatiſe of Divinity, he writes thus of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches,<note n="(x)" place="margin">Medull. SS. Theol. l. 1. c. 39. th. 27.</note> that <hi>as their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion requires, the light of nature, &amp; equity of rules and examples of Scripture doe teach, they may and alſo ought frequently to enter into a mutuall confederation and conſociation among themſelves in Claſſes and Synods, that they may uſe common conſent and mutuall help as much as commodiouſly may be done, in thoſe things eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally which are of greater moment.</hi> Now as in particular Congregations the greateſt acts of power and juriſdiction which are exerciſed therein, receive their ſtrength from <hi>common conſent,</hi> and doe conſiſt therein: ſo if in matters of greater weight the <hi>common conſent</hi> of Synods is to be uſed, then is a power and authority aſſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; then ought not particular Churches to proceed without and againſt the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:112189:73"/>authority of common conſent in Synods. And that <hi>mutuall help</hi> of other Churches is then moſt effectuall, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is not onely adviſe, but authority alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the ſame. Though D.A. adde in the ſame place, that <hi>this combination doth neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a new forme of the Church, neither ought by any meanes to deſtroy or empaire that liberty &amp; power which Chriſt hath left unto his Church, for the directing &amp; furthering whereof it onely ſerveth:</hi> this we alſo willingly grant. When a particular Congregation is hindred &amp; ſtayed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exerciſe of their authority in an unlawfull buſineſſe, in an unjuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication or electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their liberty &amp; power is not hereby deſtroyed or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but rectifyed and preſerved. Here is to be remembred that which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Par. (as was noted before) ſayth upon like occaſion: when ſome objected that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the villages in the Netherlands wanted the power of excommunication, he replyes,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Pol. Ecc. l. 3. c. 23. p. 349.</note> 
                     <hi>Imo poteſtas excommunicandi, ordinandi, &amp; juriſdictionis caeterae illis illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata relinquitur, &amp;c. The power of excommunication, ordination and other juriſdiction, remaines unto them uncorrupted, &amp;c.</hi> though they doe not proceed thereunto but with common conſent of the Claſſis.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. After this, D. Ames in his Diſputation againſt Bellarmine touching Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods or Councels, doth ſundry times acknowledge that they have more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then onely to counſell and adviſe. This is to be obſerved in divers povnts: as firſt in the Queſtion whether the greater Prelates onely have <hi>jus ſuffragii deciſivi,</hi> the right or authority of a determining or definitive ſuffrage; or whether the ſame belong unto the Elders alſo, or inferiour Officers, to whom Bellarmine allowes a conſulting voyce, but not a definitive. Here D. Ames according to the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinion of the Proteſtants,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Bellarm. enerv. Tom. 2. l. 1. de Conc. c. 2.</note> allowes unto them alſo the right and authority of ſuffrages, when they are deputed and ſent as the Delegates of their Churches unto Synods. This he oft repeateth. And although he ſay<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. th. 8.</note> that <hi>in matters of faith there is no judgement belongs unto men, but of inquiſition, diſcretion &amp; conſultation, and that therefore that whole diſtinction betwixt perſons defining and conſulting is vaine:</hi> yet it is manifeſt and undenyable that in the cenſuring of Hereticks that erre in matters of faith, there is an Eccleſiaſticall judgement belonging unto men, and a definitive ſentence to be pronounced againſt ſuch. The matters of faith are as little to be ſubjected or ſubmitted unto the judgement of a particular Congregation, as unto the judgement of Synods: and yet Hereticks are not to be exempted from the judgement and cenſure of either of them. D. Am. himſelf in the ſame place doth plainly acknowledge this diſtinction betwixt conſultation and definitive ſuffrage; when he ſaith<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                     <hi>Bene conſulere, majoris eſt virtutis, quam ex aliorum conſilio bene definire, quamvis hoc ſit majoris poteſtatis. To conſult well is a matter of greater vertue, then from other mens counſell to define well, although this be a matter of greater authority.</hi> Seeing therefore he confeſſeth that to have a definitive voyce is a matter of greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then to counſell and adviſe; and ſeeing withall that this power of ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and definitive voyces belongs unto the Deputies of Churches in Synods, and that by his confeſſion; it is evident that herein he aſſcribes more power unto Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods then he did in that book of Engliſh Puritaniſme.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in the queſtion whether a Generall Councell be above the Pope, or the Pope above the Councell; although D. Am. in handling the ſame, doth not ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:112189:74"/>fully and directly ſpeak againſt Bellarmine, as D. Whitaker, D. Rainolds, Iunius, Sibrandus Lubbertus, Chamierus, and other of our Divines, which maintaine that the Pope may be juſtly condemned, depoſed and Excommunicated by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Synod; yet doth he<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid. de Conc. c. 7.</note> acknowledge the Councell or Synod to be above the Pope, in the very propoſition of the queſtion, and after takes upon him the defence of the Arguments commonly uſed by Proteſtant Divines for the proofe thereof. Would he have ſpoken plainly, according to the poſitions ſet downe in that booke of Engl. Puritan. &amp; according to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. his opinion, that limiteth all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction unto a particular Congregation onely; he ſhould then have ſayd, that as the Pope hath no power over a Generall Councell, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Synod any authority over the Pope, either to depoſe, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or any way to cenſure him, but might onely counſell and adviſe him &amp;c. &amp; he ſhould as well have refuted the Proteſtants, for giving too much power to the Synod, as the Papiſts for giving too much power to the Pope. Now this he hath not done, but hath ſet down his minde in ſuch manner, that neither the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt whom he diſputed, nor the Proteſtants whoſe receyved opinion he ſeemed to maintaine, could eaſily obſerve any difference in him from our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenent.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. In another booke after this, he acknowledgeth<note n="(d)" place="margin">Caſ. Conſc. l. 4. c. 29. q 9. th. 23.</note> that <hi>it belongeth unto Claſses and Synods, when any difficulty is, to declare by common counſell and to decree, who ought to be excommunicated.</hi> Now to decree an excommunication is an act of power, whereby judiciall ſentences are determined, and in all propriety of ſpeech, doth containe more in it, then a bare counſell or admonition: and therefore herein he doth apparantly give unto Synods more authority, then onely to counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. And thus D. Burges had reaſon to underſtand this ſpeech of D. Am. which he alledgeth and approveth, and agreeably thereunto profeſſeth; that <hi>God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the uſe of</hi> Eccleſiaſticall Synods <hi>for Church affaires as well as the gathering of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                     <note n="(e)" place="margin">Rejoyn. p. 206.</note> D. A. did either acknowledge the authority of Synods in this ſentence, or els was too blame for deceyving his Reader with ambiguity of ſpeech.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. In his<note n="(f)" place="margin">Freſh ſuit ag. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. p. 90.91.</note> laſt booke which he wrote immediately before his death, when he ſpeakes of repreſentative Churches, though he diſſalow that kinde of Synod or Convocation, which is ſometimes kept in England, in reſpect of Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Officers, and in reſpect of their impoſing humane ceremonies; yet doth he not condemne the Synodall aſſemblies of Scotland, before Perth, nor the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches of France, which have their aſſociation and combination without any Hierarchy. And yet it is undenyable &amp; moſt certaine that thoſe Synods of Scotland and France have uſed Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction in cenſuring of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offendours, and were not onely for counſell and adviſe, as is further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted hereafter. Had he dealt plainly and anſwered his oppoſite fully, he ſhould have condemned the Aſſemblies of Scotland for that juriſdiction which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. his opinion and that booke of Engl. Purit.) they unjuſtly uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Yea further he doth juſtify thoſe Synods; for when as D. Burges<note n="(g)" place="margin">Rejoyn. p. 206.</note> had ſpoken of ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Synods, as have juriſdiction and authority of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as appeares by his oppoſing of them unto other Synods, which the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:112189:74"/>and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacob doe allow, which have no power to controle but <hi>by way of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonition;</hi> D. Am. in his reply unto that place, confeſſeth that D. Burges did ſpeak of<note n="(h)" place="margin">Freſh ſuit, p. 183.</note> 
                     <hi>right Eccleſiaſticall Synods,</hi> and for the other Synods of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iacob &amp; the Separatiſts, the ſame that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. allowes, he paſſeth away from them, and ſayth not a word in their defence, which yet had bene moſt pertinent unto the queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. As for thoſe places in particular which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. alledgeth out of D. Ames his <hi>Caſes of Conſcience:</hi> for the<note n="(i)" place="margin">Caſ. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſc. l. 4. c. 24. q. 4.</note> firſt of them, though it be ſayd there, that <hi>the power of remooving ſcandals and excluding the wicked, for the right thereof, and in reſpect of the firſt act, cannot be ſeparated from a true Church, becauſe it flowes immediately &amp; neceſſarily from the eſſence thereof, &amp;c.</hi> this is not againſt us. for 1. When Synods judge the cauſes of particular Churches, they doe not take away their power, but onely reſtraine and correct the abuſe of their power; the authority of particular Churches is not ſeparated from them, but the corruption or fault that appeareth in the exerciſe of their authority. They are ſtill permitted to uſe their authority and judgement in cenſures, elections, &amp;c. when the Synod perceives that they doe not goe aſtray therein. 2. Though there be a ſtreame of authority flowing immediately from the prime Churches, this hinders not, but helps and furthers the authority of Synods, unto which that power by delegation is immediately derived. And therefore as there is a fountaine of authority ſpringing out of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation; ſo there is a Sea of authority in the Synod, where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſo many fountaines, and the authority of ſo many Churches doth concurre and meet together. As for that other place, <hi>Caſ. Conſc. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 25. it is anſwered hereafter in the Allegation that is taken from D. Voetius.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for that<note n="(k)" place="margin">Caſ. conſc. l. 4. c. 29.</note> place which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne objecteth out of D. Ames, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there is ſomething more found againſt the authority of Synods, then in any thing that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. hath alledged out of him. But all that D. Ames there writes is not eaſily to be admitted. For in that chap. the Queſtion being made,<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid. qu. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether whole Churches or members of another Church, may be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>They cannot properly be excommunicated.</hi> He bringeth 3 Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. <hi>Becauſe every Church hath communion in it ſelf, out of which it can no more be caſt, then out of it ſelf.</hi> But this reaſon is inſufficient, 1. Becauſe, though every Church hath communion in it ſelf, yet not onely in it ſelf, and with it ſelf, but with other Churches alſo: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and by excommunication it may be deprived and cut off from that comfortable fellowſhip, to the great grief, terrour and ſhame thereof, for their humiliation thereby, and for the warning of others. 2. Becauſe an obſtinate and rebellious Church, by a ſentence of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be caſt out of it ſelf, and deprived of communion in it ſelf either in the diſſolution of that unlawfull ſociety, while the Magiſtrate helpes to execute the ſentence; or otherwiſe in making their communion abhominable even unto their owne conſciences, by the hand of God working with his owne ordinance, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them to Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, and depriving them of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſt, notwithſtanding any pretended ſecurity of the obſtinate.</p>
                  <p>His 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> reaſon is: <hi>Becauſe the power of excommunicating flowes from ſome ſuperiority;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:112189:75"/>but all Churches are conſtituted of Chriſt with an authority altogether equall.</hi> This is alſo a weak reaſon for 1. Though all Churches be equall, and no one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet many meeting together in a Synod, are ſuperiour to one, as was ſhewed before by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker;<note n="(m)" place="margin">Pol. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. 3. p. 129.</note> 
                     <hi>Greater is the power of a Synod, then of any one prime and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhionall Church.</hi> 2. When two Churches onely are by ſpeciall covenant united together, as it may fall out neceſſarily upon occaſion, though this combination be more imperfect, yet is this<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 345. 346.</note> reputed for a Synod: and though theſe Churches be in themſelves equall, yet when one of them falles into errour &amp; offence, then it becomes ſubject to the other, and the other hath authority over it to rebuke &amp; cenſure the ſame. This is to be obſerved by proportion of two brethren, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Church: though both of them be in their eſtate equall; yet he that offendeth becomes ſubject to the other, who thereupon hath power over him, in a degree of binding and looſing, a power of looſing and <hi>forgiving him, if he repent,</hi> a power of retaining his ſinne and binding him over to further proceeding, if he doe not repent. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3, 4. <hi>with Matt.</hi> 18. On this manner that generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of mutuall ſubjection to one another (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.) ought to take place in two Churches as well as in two perſons.</p>
                  <p>His 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the members of one Church, are neither ſubject to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, neither doe they belong immediately unto the communion of other Churches, but by the communion of their owne Church comming betwixt.</hi> The firſt part of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon touching ſubjection, is anſwered before: and for the ſecond part of it, there is no weight therein; for thoſe that belong unto the communion of other Churches but mediately, are not therefore exempted from the juriſdiction and authority of them. And againe, the covenant of communion made at the firſt confederation of Churches for their mutuall government by a Synod, remaineth firme for the continuance and exerciſe of authority, either for or againſt ſome particular members of any one Church in that combination, although that Church unjuſtly violating their covenant, ſhould refuſe to conſent or communicate with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in their acts of Eccleſiaſticall judgement and cenſure of ſome ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that which D. Ames writes in the ſame chapter, may juſtly lead us to acknowledge the neceſſity of Synods, and their authority in the cenſure of offendours.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He addes in his anſwer to the ſame queſtion, touching whole Churches &amp; members of another Church, that though they may not properly be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,<note n="(o)" place="margin">Caſ. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ. l 4. c 29. q. 11. th. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>yet for manifeſt hereſies or great faults, they may be condemned, forſaken, rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is proportionable to excommunication.</hi> If he grant this authority unto Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, thus to condemne whole Churches, then he confeſſeth that they have more power then onely to counſell or admoniſh. If he grant this authority unto any other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and not to Claſſes or Synods, the warrant from Scripture ought to be ſhewed. A cenſure proportionable to excommunication, requires an authority proportionable to theirs, that may excommunicate, for the exequution thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In the ſame chapter, propounding this caſe of conſcience,<note n="(p)" place="margin">Ibid. q. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>What is to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:112189:75"/>be done of the Paſtour, where a fit Elderſhip is wanting, or where the people doe not conſent unto ajuſt excommunication?</hi> His reſolution is, <hi>The ſolemne proceeding may be omitted: yet a good Paſtour ought to give all diligence hereunto with the reſt of the faythfull members, that the ſubſtance of the matter be ſo farre preſerved, that holy things be not given unto dogs &amp; ſwine, Mat. 7.6. and that all publick ſcandals be publickly reprooved.</hi> But by this direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither is the peace of the Miniſters conſcience provided for, nor yet the ſafety of the Church. For by what warrant may a Paſtour by his ſole authority, determine and reject ſome members as dogs, and exclude them from the holy things, from the Sacraments, and this not onely without allowance of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, but againſt the conſent of the people and body of the Congregation, or the greateſt part of it? This is in effect an excommunication, or as he calles it, the <hi>eſſence</hi> or ſubſtance of the matter: for excommunication, greater or leſſe, is the onely Eccleſiaſticall judgement appointed of God to keep holy things from being given unto dogs. To permit this authority unto the Paſtour alone, is to open a dore for tyranny, and oppreſſion of the Church; and is condemned by thoſe 4 reaſons which he gives for confirmation of his anſwer unto the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> queſtion immediately going before. It is the denyall of Synods, that drives unto ſuch extremities.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That which he here ſaith of <hi>publick reproving all publick ſcandals,</hi> is againe empeached by that which was ſayd before,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid. q. 4. th. 12, 13.</note> that <hi>in thoſe Churches which through want of diſcipline are troubled with confuſion, it is not alway neceſsary for the perſon offended to admoniſh the offendour, becauſe he ſhould oftentimes in vaine beginne that which he had no power to finiſh:</hi> that <hi>the commandement of ſolemne admoniſhing of a brother offending, doth then onely binde, when there is ſome hope that the ſame will prevaile to take away the offence, either immediately or mediately. for a meanes is ſo farre good, as it makes to the obtaining of his end.</hi> As though God did not bleſſe his owne ordinance above our hope and reaſon, above all that we can thinke: or as though we were not to uſe his meanes and leave the ſucceſſe unto him. He that begins a good work and proceeds ſo farre till he be ſtopped by others, is accepted of God as if he had finiſhed it.</p>

As M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baynes was a man of ſingular note for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and piety, ſo is his teſtimony of ſingular note to ſhew the right uſe &amp; power of Synods, not onely for counſell, but for authority to cenſure and judge Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cauſes; ſo that particular Churches may not doe within themſelves, what they would without their conſent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. After he had ſet downe 4 concluſions, wherein we agree with the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, he comes to ſpeak of the poynt of difference, and ſayth,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Dioceſ. tryall, p. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>That wherein we contradict one another, is, we affirme that no ſuch head Church was ordained either virtually or actually, but that all Churches were ſingular congregations, equall, independent each of other in regard of ſubjection. Secondly, we ſay, were there a Dioceſan granted, yet will it not follow, that Pariſh-Churches ſhould be without their government within themſelves, but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:112189:76"/>onely ſubject in ſome more common and tranſcendent caſes. As it was with the Synagogues &amp; that Nationall Church of the Iewes, and as it is betwixt Provinciall and Dioceſan Churches.</hi> This doe I willingly aſſent unto: And this is no other thing then that which is practiſed in theſe Reformed Churches, with whom we are united. Here is no one head-Church, that hath more authority then another, all Congregations are equall, independent each of other: here is no ſubjection to any one Dioceſan: all are equally and mutually ſubject to the Synod conſiſting of many: their dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is not upon one more then another, but it is onely in regard of many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined; notwithſtanding which combination they have their government within themſelves: being ſubject to the Synod onely in ſome more weighty and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſes.</p>

                        <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 3. Ordinarie power with the execution thereof, was not given to the communitie of the Church, or to the whole multitude of the faithfull, ſo that they were the immediate and firſt receptacle, receiving it from Chriſt, and virtually deriving it to others. This I ſet downe againſt the Divines of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; our prime Divines, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the Sorboniſts, who doe maintaine it at this day. Yea this ſeemeth to have been <hi>Tertullians</hi> errour; for in his booke <hi>depudicitia,</hi> he maketh Chriſt to haue left all Chriſtians with like power, but the Church for her honour, did diſpoſe it as we ſee. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a politick body, and naturall, deceived them, while they will apply all that is in theſe to Chriſts myſticall body, not remembring that <hi>analogon</hi> is not <hi>in omni ſimile,</hi> for then ſhould it be the ſame with the <hi>analogatum.</hi> True it is, all civill power is in the body politick, the collections of ſubjects, then in a King from them: And all the power of hearing, ſeeing, they are in the whole man, which doth produce them effectually, though formally and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they are in the eare and eye. But the reaſon of this is, becauſe theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are naturall, and what ever is naturall, doth firſt agree to the communitie or <hi>totum,</hi> and afterward to a particular perſon and part, but all that is in this body, cannot hold in Chriſts myſticall body. In a politick body, power is firſt in the communitie, in the King from them, but all Eccleſiaſticall power is firſt in our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:112189:77"/>King before any in the Church from him. But to whom ſhould he firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this power, but to his Queene? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſidering this power is not any Lordly power, but a power of doing ſervice to the Church for Chriſt his ſake: therefore it is fit it ſhould be committed to ſome perſons, and not to the whole communitie, which are the Queen of Chriſt. For it is not fit a King ſhould commit power to his Queene to ſerve herſelf properly: but to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who in regard of this relation ſhould ſtand diſtinguiſhed from her. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in naturall bodies, the power of ſeeing is firſt immediately in the man, from the man in the eye and particular members: In the myſticall body, the faith of a beleever is not firſt immediately in all, then in the beleever, but firſt of all and immediately in the perſonall beleever, for whoſe good it ſerveth more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then for the whole, every man being to live by his owne faith. The power of Prieſthood was not firſt in the Church of Iſrael, ſo derived to the Prieſt: but immediately from Chriſt ſeated in Aaron and his ſonnes. <hi>Object.</hi> Yea they were given the Church <hi>intuitu ejuſdem tanquam finis &amp; totius. Anſw.</hi> I but this is not enough, that power may be ſayd to be immediately received by the Church as the firſt receptacle of it, and from it derived to others, as the power of ſeeing is not onely given <hi>intuitu hominis</hi> as the end of it, and the <hi>totum</hi> to whom it agreeth, but is <hi>in homine</hi> as the firſt ſubject from whom it commeth to the eye. But the power even of ordinary Miniſters is not in the Church. For as all are ſayd not to have been Apoſtles, ſo not to have been Doctors. But if the power of ordinarie teaching had been given to every beleever, all ſhould have been made Doctors, though not to continue ſo in exerciſing the power. Secondly, were the power in the Church, the Church, ſhould not onely call them, but make them out of vertue and power received into her ſelfe: then ſhould the Church have a true Lordlike power in regard of her Miniſters. Beſides, there are many in the community of Chriſtians uncapable of this power regularly, as women and children. This concluſion in my judgement <hi>Victoria, Soto</hi> and others deny, with greater ſtrength of reaſon then the contrary is maintained.</q>

                     <q>
                        <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, ordinary power of miniſteriall government is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the execution of it, to the Senat or Preſbyterie of the Church. If any faile in any office, the Church hath not power of ſupplying that, but a miniſtery of calling one whom Chriſt hath deſcribed, that from Chriſt he may have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of office given him in the place vacant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 5. Laſtly, though the community have not power given her, yet ſuch eſtate by Chriſt her huſband is put on her, that all power is to be executed in ſuch manner, as ſtandeth with reſpect to her excellencie. Hence it is, that the governours are in many things of greater moment to take the conſent of the people with them. Not that they have joynt power of the keyes with them, but becauſe they ſuſtaine the perſon of the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and therefore cannot be otherwiſe dealt with, without open diſhonour in ſuch things, which belong in common to the whole congregation.</q>

                  <p>Afterwards againe,<note n="(h)" place="margin">P. 88.</note> ſpeaking of ſome derivation of power from the Church, in taking in Officers, he ſhewes that the Church doth this onely as an inſtrument,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:112189:78"/>in taking that perſon whom Chriſt deſcribeth and would have to be placed in this or that office: but hath not this power in herſelf either formally or virtually. And from this Stewardlike power of the Church, he declares that Officers in the Church are not to adminiſter in the name of the Church, but in the name of Chriſt: <hi>As a Butler taken in by a ſervant, doth execute his office, not in master Stewards name, but in his maſters, who onely out of power did conferre it on him.</hi> By theſe &amp; ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other aſſertions, it is apparant that <hi>Mr Baynes</hi> was of a farre different opinion from <hi>Mr Dav.</hi> touching the ſtate of particular Churches, &amp; the authority of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.

                     <hi>As for Synods, if they be lawfully called, well ordered, and their conſtitutions by royall

Now as for the preſent Synods, ſuch as are in theſe Reformed Churches, they are ſuch as he mentioneth here, called and aſſembled by authority of the Magiſtrates, and their Acts approved, confirmed and ratifyed by them. This may be ſeen in the Records of that Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Synod holden at Dort, Anno 1618. and 1619. where<note n="(o)" place="margin">Act. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Dordr. Seſ. 138.</note> the Decree of the States Generall, which are the ſoveraigne and ſupreme Magiſtrates in theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is inſerted among the Acts of the Synod, for the ratification thereof. And this is not onely obſerved in Nationall Synods, but in the Provinciall Synods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, held every yeare, where the States have alſo their Deputies, Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, which ordinarily are preſent in thoſe Aſſemblies, to ſee that all things be well ordered therein. Thus farre therefore, according to his relation, there is an obedience and ſubjection due unto Synods. Againe whereas he proceedeth to deſcribe their opinion, on this manner; <hi>If they want Regall authority to aſsemble or to ratify them; they thinke that by Divine or Apoſtolicall ordinance, their decrees or canons ought not to be impoſed on any Churches, without their particular and free conſents:</hi> It is here to be obſerved how he notes onely what <hi>they thinke,</hi> without approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; he declares their opinion, but doth not acknowledge it to be his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither had he reaſon ſo to judge: for in the primitive Church, when there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrates, there was then a lawfull uſe of Synods, and that by Divine and Apoſtolicall ordinance, as hath bene ſhewed before. And as for <hi>particular conſents:</hi> if any Church walked diſorderly and offenſively, there is no reaſon to think that the cenſures and decrees of Synods againſt ſuch Churches ſhould be differed untill they did conſent unto the cenſuring of themſelves. It was ſufficient that at their firſt combination there was a generall and free conſent, to ſubmit themſelves in the Lord mutually unto other Churches Synodically aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. And yet more plainely, in the ſame place he profeſſeth that he diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in judgement from them, when he concludes, <hi>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in defence of thoſe later Diſciplinarians, from whom although in ſomethings I confeſſe I diſſent, yet I cannot conſent to the D. taking away of their innocency.</hi> Though in ſome things D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. did unjuſtly charge them, yet M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> S. the Refuter of D.

                     <hi>That every pariſh by right hath ſufficient authority within it ſelfe immediately derived from Chriſt, for the government of it ſelfe in all cauſes Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> this aſſertion is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but with ſundry cautions.

Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. de Gub. Eccl p. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The fourth caution is, that the authority given to a particular Church, is not ſufficient for the handling of all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:112189:79"/>cauſes by their owne judgement, but for thoſe onely which are ſo particular, that they may be deemed altogether proper unto it. For whatſoever caſe falles out belonging unto the common order of neighbour Churches, we judge that the ſame is to be brought unto a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aſſembly, wherein theſe Churches doe joyntly meet together.

                  <p n="3">III. It is to be obſerved how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. doth miſtranſlate the words of <hi>D. Voe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> by omitting a word of ſpeciall importance, which both he and <hi>D.

For though the Church may not utterly or quite and cleane commit her power to the truſt of others; yet in ſome kinde and in ſome meaſure it may and ought to be done: For the kindes, <hi>D. Voetius</hi> gives inſtance in <hi>divers acts, belonging to the calling of a Miniſter, which may and ought to be performed by ſome certaine members thereof;</hi> and the ſame is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for divers other acts of like nature: And for the meaſure, ſo (as he alſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) that Chriſt the Bridegroome, <hi>reſerve the ſupreme authority unto himſelf;</hi> which is then acknowledged by his people, when they doe not receive nor follow the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or ſentence of any man or Officer, of any particular Congregation, or of any Synod, further then they in their conſciences finde it to agree with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſt revealed in his word. As the Lord himſelf by an immediate call committed power and authority unto the truſt of his ſervants, whoſe faithfulnes is thereupon commended: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11, 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7. ſo doth the Church alſo, both in the ordinary calling of men unto office, and in the occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſending of them about particular workes and affaires of the Church; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19, 23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.3. &amp; eſpecially in communicating their power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to give ſentence in Synods.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That <hi>D. Voetius</hi> doth allow the authority and juriſdiction of Synods, we have many teſtimonies our of this very book of his, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. alledgeth. I. Though he ſhew that Eccleſiaſticall power of judgement is firſt and immediately in particular Churches, yet he notes withall,<note n="(x)" place="margin">Deſp. cauſ.

II. Speaking of a publick Reformation, which he calles <hi>authoritative,</hi> he ſhewes<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 62.</note> how it (being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall) may be done either <hi>in an univerſall Synod, or without a Synod.</hi> Speaking of Reformation made by inſtruction, exhortation, or invitation, he ſayth it may be done of any one Preacher, yea and in ſome ſort of any one Chriſtian: but for the Reformation wherein there is <hi>an actuall change of publick worſhip,</hi> he ſaith, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the help and conſent of many, and thoſe not of one order, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre; and that <hi>one or a few are not ſufficient, unleſse it fall out that the authority and parts
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:112189:80"/>of thoſe many who are intereſted therein, be devolved unto them.</hi> Thus he alloweth the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Synods, while he acknowledgeth that the authority of many may be derived and communicated unto a few; which is the very thing wherein the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Synods doth conſiſt. III. He defends<note n="(z)" place="margin">P. 79.</note> Luther appealing from the ſentence of excommunication given out by Pope Leo the tenth, unto a lawfull Generall Synod: he allowes the like appeale made by the Arch-biſhop of Colen, and the appeale of the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde, the forme whereof was affixed or ſet up at Rome; in all which the authority of Synods is acknowledged. IV. He allowes<note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 85.</note> the example of thoſe Churches, which determined matters <hi>by a publick, and Nationall or Provinciall judgement.</hi> Speaking of the Reformers of Religion, he ſayth,<note n="(b)" place="margin">P. 169.</note> Luther had the right of ſuffrage, and uſed the ſame in the Univerſity of Wittebergh, as one of the Profeſſours; in the Church, as one of the Paſtours; <hi>in the neighbour-churches of Saxony, as a member of them, in the name and by commiſſion from the Church of Witteberg, and not further.

                  <p>Laſtly, to come from his words unto his practiſe; Whereas this learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt was deputed and ſent<note n="(f)" place="margin">Act. Sy. nod.

If Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods might goe no further then to counſell and admoniſh, then had D. Voetius with the reſt bene an uſurper of unlawfull power. Beſides, this order of Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Synodall aſſemblies, together with their juriſdiction and authority, in ſuch ſort as it was before, and is ſtill practiſed in theſe Reformed Churches, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed<note n="(h)" place="margin">Rercke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>ANSVV. I.

                     <q>We offer &amp; permit with moſt willing mindes (having the licence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as it may well be for this purpoſe) that all our controverſies and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever, which have bene ſowne and brought in among us ſithence the beginning of this breach, and ſince the firſt day we began to ſtrive, untill this preſent time and houre: to be debated, decided and determined by Arbiters, being none of this our Congregation, and yet from among the brethren, our countrie men, equally and indifferently, by the parties diſagreeing, to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen upon this condition, that not onely the election of Miniſters and beſides all other things done by the order of the ſayd diſcipline, ſtand in ſuſpence, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or diſallowed by the determination and judgement of the Arbiters to be choſen as is aforeſaid. written the 5. of April, Anno 1557.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other part of the Church did in like manner witneſſe their conſent, by their writing, the copie whereof was as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We ſubmit ourſelves and are contented to commit all manner of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that have heretofore riſen amongſt us in the Church, to ſuch Arbiters as the Magiſtrate hath appointed, and to all ſuch as they call unto them to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and determining thereof, according to Gods word and good reaſon. And thus ſimply and plainly without any manner of exception or condition. In wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whereof we have ſubſcribed our names the 5. of April, Anno 1557.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though there were ſome differences betwixt theſe parties in other particulars, yet they all agreed in this, to commit authority &amp; power unto ſome out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whom they would ſet up as Judges over them. Hereby it doth appeare that they did not confine and reſtraine the judgement of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:112189:82"/>within the limits of one particular Congregation onely. And if a particular Church might thus referre their controverſies to the judgement of foure or five perſons out of themſelves, then might they as well or better be referred to the judgement of many Churches united together in Claſſes and Synods.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. This Engliſh Church which ſojourned at <hi>Franckford,</hi> for foure or five yeares in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> time, was not a ſetled and eſtabliſhed Church: they wanted the opportunity of combining themſelves with other Engliſh Churches. It was the miſery of this Church, that they wanted the help of ordinary Claſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: and it is unreaſonable to make the ſpeciall defect or want of ſome one Church, a precedent for other Churches, to deprive them of that mutuall help which they may conveniently enjoy, and which God offers unto them. This Engliſh Church<note n="(t)" place="margin">Diſc. of troubl. in Engl. Ch. at Franckf. p. 27, &amp;c. p. 62, &amp;c. p. 135, &amp;c.</note> was exerciſed with great troubles and continuall diſſentions all the time of their abode at Franckford, to the great grief and offence of many. The forme of their Diſcipline, and theſe Articles here objected by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can. were not fully agreed upon: the Paſtour and the Elders with ſome of the Church diſſented from the greater part of the Congregation. And in ſuch caſe, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fenner, before mentioned, doth teſtify,<note n="(v)" place="margin">S. Theol. l. 7. c. 7. p. 278, &amp;c.</note> the controverſy ought to have bene brought to a greater Senate, to a Claſſis or Synod, which he calles a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of more Churches, for the deciding thereof. The want of this was the cauſe of their woe.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The Engliſh Church at Franckford in the want of a Claſſis might ſo much the rather allow appeales unto the Congregation, becauſe there were in that Church many learned men, able to diſcerne and judge of cauſes. In that Church<note n="(x)" place="margin">Diſc. &amp;c p. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſet up an Vniverſity,</hi> and choſe ſeverall men for the reading of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, and Divinity lectures. The learned men that repaired unto this Church were alſo as famous for their piety and ſincerity, enduring perſecution for the Goſpell of Chriſt, chooſing rather to live in baniſhment with their afflicted brethren, then to enjoy the pleaſures and promotions of Antichriſt, which they might have had in their owne countrie, if they would have bowed their necks to his yoke. In ſuch a Church it was more tolerable to appeale unto the body of the Congregation, then in many other that are farre unlike. And yet if ſuch a Church, abounding with ſo many Worthies, could not well ſubſiſt alone, in their want of a Claſſicall government, but fell into ſo great contentions and ſcandals; this may juſtly ſerve for the warning of other Churches, and teach them to ſeek the help of neighbour-churches, &amp; to ſubmit themſelves mutually unto ſuch combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Lord ſhall give opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when as afterwards it pleaſed God to viſit his people, and to reſtore the light of the Goſpel and true Religion unto England by that gracious and noble inſtrument of his goodnes, <hi>Qu. Elizabeth,</hi> of ever bleſſed memory, then theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eminent lights of his Church returning againe into their country, did give a plaine teſtimony unto this trueth, that all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is not limited unto a particular Congregation. Some of them being promoted unto chief places of government in England, did by their practiſe profeſſe that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches may ſubmit themſelves unto a ſuperiour authority out of their owne
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:112189:82"/>Congregation. Some of them became Miniſters of the Church of Scotland, &amp; ſtood for the maintenance of that Diſcipline, which from the beginning of the Reformation, acknowledged the authority and juriſdiction of Synods. None of them (for ought I ever heard) that dreamed of the ſingle uncompounded policie. Though there were ſome differences among them concerning the government of the Church, yet no one of them or of thoſe other exiles who had ſojourned at <hi>Straſbrough, Baſel, Zurick, Arrow, Geneva</hi> and other places, in Q. Maries dayes, that left behinde them any monument of their agreement with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cann. in limiting Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction unto a particular Church. But of this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we have occaſion to ſpeak further hereafter,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Chap. 7.

It cannot be ſhewed that ever ſuch a Generall Councell was held. When Bellarmine accuſeth Melancthon for requiring ſuch conditions of a Synod, that neither the perſons nor cauſes of men ſhould be condemned, and that ſo nothing at all ſhould be decreed in the Synod: Junius anſwereth that this is fayned or forged of him; and ſhewes further that though it doe not become the Church to uſe a bloody cure, and corporall puniſhments, yet there is a more wholeſome order, and tells what that is, ſaying,<note n="(f)" place="margin">N. 40.</note>

                     <hi>As for us, we deny both; and will (God willing) confute the firſt affirmation in the firſt book, and the latter in the ſecond.</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. cannot juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyther of thoſe aſſertions: for firſt, the ſingle uncompounded policie doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre a new forme of Synods: if it be not ſo, let him ſhew when and where ſuch a forme was ever uſed of old. And for the ſecond, it is granted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. his owne confeſſion, when he alledgeth<note n="(h)" place="margin">Apol. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. p. 47.</note> that <hi>other Churches have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of hindring a faulty election, but by admonition, which power every Chriſtian hath in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for his good.</hi> Is not this to give almoſt no power to Synods? Bellarmine to ſhew the divine originall of Synods alledgeth <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. <hi>there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> Iunius aſſenting to him, ſayth<note n="(i)" place="margin">In cap. 3. l. 1. de Conc, n. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>It is alſo demonſtrated in theſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul,</hi> 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. <hi>The ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> Both places import an authority whereunto ſubjection is required. When Bellarmine ſayth of Biſhops in Synods, that they are not Counſellours but Judges; Junius no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note n="(k)" place="margin">N. 2.</note> that <hi>they are neither Counſellours nor Iudges, but declarers &amp; miniſters of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in the holy Scripture:</hi> in which words he aſſcribeth as much power and juriſdiction unto Synods as he doth unto particular Churches. His meaning for both (according to his uſe of ſpeech) is that they are not abſolute but miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all judges.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Bellarmine reckoneth up ſundry ſorts of perſons that may be preſent at Synods, ſome as judges, which have a deciding or determining voyce; ſome for diſputation, which have a conſulting voyce; ſome as ſervitours or attendants; ſome for the defence of the Synod, to maintaine peace, &amp;c. Junius denyeth not this but ſhewes that his enumeration is inſufficient, ſaying,<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid. in c. 15. n. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>It is to be added, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as parties or perſons accuſed, whoſe cauſe is to be handled: for certainly it is inhumane that any ſhould be condemned not cited, or not heard: Others againe to be Auditours, ſeeking their edification by enjoying that communication of holy things.</hi> Hereby it is plaine that he acknowledged the juriſdiction of Synods, and that they were not onely for counſell; both becauſe he allowes a diſtinction of them in the Synod which had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:112189:83"/>the authority of a determining voyce, from them that did onely diſpute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; and becauſe he intimates a judiciall proceeding in the Synods, by mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning parties accuſed, their citing or calling of them, &amp; the condemning of them, which imports a further matter then onely of admonition or counſell. Whereas Bellarmine accuſeth us that we allow any learned men, though Laicks, to have a determining voyce, let their office be what it will: Junius anſwereth,<note n="(m)" place="margin">N. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things have none of us ſayd or thought, as they are here layd downe. This is that which we ſay; ſuch are to be taken into the Synod which are furniſhed with gifts and calling; which for gifts are godly, honeſt, learned; for their calling, which are either ordinarily appointed to teach, or extraordinarily ſent for and brought by juſt authority.</hi> Now this neceſſity of a calling which he ſo<note n="(n)" place="margin">See c. 16. n. 10. &amp; 18. &amp; 20. &amp;c. 17. n. 1.</note> often urgeth and requireth to be in the members of a Synod, doth argue a ſpeciall power and authority belonging unto them, by vertue whereof they may give ſentence in the judgement of cauſes; whereas to admoniſh or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell requires no more power then that which every Chriſtian hath in another, for his good, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. himſelf confeſſeth. To the ſame purpoſe Junius ſhewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bellarmine, that the meaning of Theodoſius and Valentinian was not to admit Biſhops onely, but that<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. n. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>thoſe onely might heare, examine, and give ſentence in a Synod, which being ſent from the Churches unto the Synod, were reckoned up of the Biſhops, according to their letters of publick authority which they were wont to exhibit.</hi> Againe he ſayth,<note n="(p)" place="margin">N. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>They which are preſent without the authority of the Church, of them ſome may one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare, as the laicks</hi> or common people: <hi>ſome may be uſed in conſultations, as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, eſpecially Eccleſiaſticall perſons; but they may not give definitive ſentence.</hi> And thus ſtill by diſtinguiſhing thoſe that gave counſell, from thoſe that gave ſentence in the Synod, it appeares he acknowledged a power of juriſdiction in Synods, and that they were not onely for counſell. So when Bellarmine ſayth it was a fault in the Councell of Baſill, that Preſbyters or other learned men beſides Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, were allowed to have not onely a conſulting voyce, but a deciding ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, &amp; affirmeth that this was againſt the cuſtome of all antiquity, &amp;c. Junius anſwereth,<note n="(q)" place="margin">N. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>This we denye: for it was the firſt inſtitution, Act.</hi> 15. <hi>and not onely the manner and cuſtome. Seeing therefore there was ſuch an inſtitution of the Apoſtles, &amp; in their aſſembly, what need was there to alledge cuſtome? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Bellarmine chargeth the Proteſtants as holding that a Synod is nothing but an inquiſition; and that Chriſt alone and his written word hath a determining voyce: Junius ſayth,<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ibid. in c. 18. n. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>It is falſe. for Synods have both an inquiſition of that which is true, juſt, holy by religious communication, and alſo a miniſteriall giving of ſentence.</hi> Though he ſhew there and in many annotations following, that it is not lawfull for Chriſtians to obey them further then they agree with the Scriptures; that their ſentence of it ſelf is but a perſuaſion, and not a conſtraint; a miniſteriall judgement, not of abſolute authority of itſelf, &amp;c. yet he<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">N. 3.</note> grants the Lord hath commanded that we ſhould obey the ſentence of a lawfull Synod, aſſembled together in his name, &amp;c. He ſayth,<note n="(t)" place="margin">N. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Synods have true judgements, ſo farre as they are of God according to the tables of his trueth and commandement: of themſelves they are not judgements, but declarations, publications, and miniſteriall pronouncings of the trueth and judgements of God.</hi> And more then this cannot be yeelded to any Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:112189:84"/>judicatory whatſoever. Herein he fully grants as much juriſdiction to Synods, as belongs to any particular Congregation or Elderſhip, either apart or joyntly together.</p>
                  <p>When Bellarmine blames the Proteſtants for their exception againſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, Junius anſwereth,<note n="(v)" place="margin">Ibid. in c. 21. n. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>It is the ordinary way of right in every appeale,</hi> that the judgement of Synods, and the exequution of their ſentence be ſuſpended and ſtayed ſo long untill the matter be againe examined in another more free or greater Aſſembly, &amp;c. This anſwer had bene needles and impertinent, unleſſe Synods had more power then of counſell and admonition onely. He ſayth,<note n="(x)" place="margin">N. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Certainly in every juſt Synod, Hereticks being cited, heard, preſent, or willfully hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have bene condemned: &amp;c.</hi> When Bellarm. objects that Proteſtants will have nothing to be determined in Synods, and ſo ſtrifes to be never ended; Junius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,<note n="(y)" place="margin">N. 23.</note> that he perverts their meaning, and referres us to his preface, <hi>nota</hi> 40. where the Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction of Synods is plainely avouched.</p>
                  <p>IUnius proceeding to the examination of his ſecond book touching Synods, where Bellarmine repeats, that <hi>Synods of Biſhops may judge all controverſies both of faith and manners,</hi> Junius anſwereth,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adv. in Bell. l. 2. deCo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cl. c. 1. n. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>We have granted it of thoſe that are lawfull Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi> When Bellarmine had ſayd that <hi>nothing is greater then a lawfull and approved Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell;</hi> Junius anſwereth,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 4. n. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>It is falſe: for Chriſt is greater, and the Scripture is greater: ſeeing Chriſt and the Scripture are great of themſelves: the Church is great by them, &amp;c.</hi> But this anſwer had bene inſufficient &amp; not direct enough, if my oppoſites opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were true. For then according to their opinion, he might more fitly have anſwered: that the authority of a particular Congregation is greater then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Generall Synod; becauſe though the counſell and adviſe of the Synod was more to be reverenced in reſpect of many excellently learned and godly men from many Churches that were in it; yet ſeeing Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a particular Congregation, therefore the ſame is greater in the power of cenſuring, and in the uſe of the keyes for binding and looſing of impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſeeing Synods have no juriſdiction at all over any other Churches.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when Bellarmine ſets downe this inſolent propoſition, that the Pope cannot commit, neither unto a Synod, nor to any man the coactive judgement over himſelf, but onely the diſcretive: Iunius anſwereth,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. in c. 18. n. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The propoſition is moſt true, he cannot commit: becauſe God hath committed it to the Synod and lawfull Councell. Wherefore we ſay on the contrary, neither can he commit it (for if he be the ſervant of God, God hath committed the judgement concerning him unto his Church) neither can he reject it: but though he be unwilling, yet both the Church is bound to judge concerning him, and he to undergoe the judgement thereof, diſcretive and coactive, howſoever it pleaſe men to call it.</hi> If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. doe fully agree with Junius, as he profeſſeth, then muſt he acknowledge that Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is not limited to a particular Church; that lawfull Synods have authority not onely to counſell and admoniſh the Pope himſelf, and ſo other obſtinate offendours, but alſo to cenſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to give ſentence both of directive &amp; coactive judgement againſt them, as occaſion requires. Junius to make this more plaine, repeats it againe, and ſpeaking of the Synods judging the Pope, ſaith,<note n="(c)" place="margin">N. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Truely we grant that he cannot appoynt judges in his owne cauſe, becauſe God hath

                     <hi>This is a fallacy from that which is not the cauſe, as they call it.

As the heat is more principally in the fire then in the water, becauſe it is in the water by reaſon of the fire. So (ſayth he) ſeeing this juriſdiction and fullnes of power is given to the Church neceſsarily and primarily, but to the Pope onely ſecundarily, and by the Church it is manifeſt that it is more in the Church, then in the Pope. What that learned wrighter ſayth of the Churches power in compariſon with the Pope, holds in all other parallell inſtances.</hi> ANSVV. Firſt, had M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. repeated this Argument of D. Whitaker fully and juſtly as it is ſet downe by himſelf, then might the Reader have ſeen therein a plaine &amp; evident teſtimony for the authority of Synods; but divers things being omitted in the beginning, middle and end of it, thereby the trueth is obſcured and hidden from his Readers.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of it, D. Whitaker propounds it thus, <hi>If the fullnes of power be in the Church, not in the Pope, then it is evident, that it hath more authority then the Pope: but the firſt is true: therefore the ſecond alſo.</hi> Now by the Church in this place, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Generall Synod or Councell, as appeares by the title of this Queſtion no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning of it, viz.<note n="(h)" place="margin">DeCon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Qu. 5. c. 1. with c. 3. Arg. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether the Synod be above the Pope:</hi> and if he had not ſo meant it, this his Argument had bene beſide the Queſtion. And therefore while D. Whitaker here directly concludeth <hi>a fullnes of power</hi> in Synods, and as he further calles it in this ſame place, <hi>that higheſt authority and juriſdiction which Christ hath left unto his Church;</hi> it is manifeſt hereby that he did not hold them to be onely for counſell &amp; admonition; and ſo was farre from limiting all Eccleſiaſticall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction unto a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>In the middle, in the confirmation of this Argument, D. Whit. ſaith, <hi>For if all this power were in the Pope, or in any one man principally and eſſentially, then he dying it ſhould periſh, and ſo the Church ſhould altogether looſe it. But it is not loſt, though the Pope dye a thouſand times, but it remaineth with the Church, without which the Pope though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving could have no part of this authority.</hi> Now to argue on this manner againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority we aſſcribe unto Synods, by comparing them with particular Churches, as he doth againſt the Pope compared with Synods, would be inconſequent, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, and no parallel inſtance; becauſe the title of the Church is no where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the Pope, or unto any one perſon, as it is unto an aſſembly of Miniſters,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:112189:87"/>Governours, or Deputies of Churches met together in the name of Chriſt in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: becauſe though we aſſcribe unto Synods ſome juriſdiction, yet we doe not ſay that all power is in them originally, and ſo to be derived unto others as is ſayd of the Pope; and conſequently becauſe there is no ſuch danger that the power of the Church ſhould be loſt and periſh by the death of ſuch as are members of the Synod, as might be by the death of the Pope, if all power were primarily and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in him alone. And therefore it is a vaine aſſertion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. touching this argument of D. Whit. viz <hi>What that learned wrighter ſayth of the Churches power in compariſon with the Pope, holds in all other parallell inſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the end of this Argument proſequuted by D. Whitak. he concludeth thus: <hi>Wherefore ſeeing it is certaine that this power is given unto the Church primarily, and not unto the Pope but ſecondarily and by accident, and ſeeing the Church is repreſented in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod: it is of neceſſity that the Synod muſt be above the Pope.</hi> And thus moſt evidently he grants unto the Synod, as being a repreſentative Church, a power &amp; juriſdiction above the Pope, a power which conſiſts in binding and looſing, ſhutting &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, retaining and remitting of ſinnes, as himſelf here explaines it, and ſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to them which allow no more unto Synods, but counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. Why did M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Davenp. omit and refuſe to name the Synod, which D. Whit. ſo expreſſely mentioneth, applying &amp; yeelding unto the Synod that power which he there pleades for?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as for that ſimilitude of fire and water, though it be granted that heat is more principally in the fire then in the water, becauſe it is in the water by reaſon of the fire: yet hereby heat is not denyed to be in the water, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary acknowledged to be derived into the water; and experience ſhewes that by the heat ſo communicated unto the water many excellent effects are produced for the ſervice of man. And ſo when Eccleſiaſticall authority is by the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and communicated to Eccleſiaſticall Officers in calling of them, then doth it belong unto them, though ſecondarily and leſſe principally, as both D. Whita. confeſſeth &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. himſelf repeateth.</p>
                  <p>THat it may yet further appeare how unjuſtly the name of <hi>D.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> For the firſt Queſtion, touching the neceſſity of Synods: There he brings 8 reaſons to prove the neceſſity and profit of them. I will not inſiſt upon each of them as I might, but mention onely one or two of them. <q>The third cauſe is, <hi>ſayth he,</hi>

                        </gap>, or good order, and right and lawfull diſcipline may both be appoynted and maintained, and that Canons may be made and confirmed. For the Church hath alwayes had authority of making and enacting Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes, and of preſcribing them to others, and of puniſhing thoſe which did not obſerve them.</q> And this authority hath alwayes bene accounted neceſſary. This was more then counſelling or admoniſhing.<note n="(k)" place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                     <q>The eight and laſt, and that the chiefeſt cauſe <hi>of Synods</hi> is, that even as in Politick and Civill judgements malefactours upon examination are accuſed and condemned; ſo in the Church Hereticks might be condemned and pronounced anathema by publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the trueth might be vindicated from their calumnies. But as there, judgement is not to be given according to the will of the judge, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law: ſo here Hereticks, enemies of faith and religion, are not to be condemned but according to the publick and Imperiall law, that is, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For a Synod is as it were a publick Court, or Imperiall Chamber, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, wherein the Judges hearing both ſides do give ſentence, and decree matters of greateſt weight. For although Hereticks may be condemned of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Churches apart: yet when they are condemned as it were of the whole Church, the ſentence is more ſolemne and of greater weight. So Arius was condemned firſt of Alexander and the Councell at Alexandria, but afterward with greater authority by the Synod of Nice, &amp;c.</q> By theſe words of D. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker we may ſee what wrong they doe unto him, which pretend that he ſhould deny the juriſdiction of Synods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſecond Queſtion is, by whoſe authority Synods are to be aſſembled. Here D. Whitaker relating how Bellarmine pleads for the Popes authority,<note n="(l)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. q. 2 c. 2. p. 42, &amp;c.</note> repeats his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument, taken from an ancient Canon wherein it was concluded, <hi>that without the minde of the Romane Biſhop it was not lawfull to celebrate or hold Synods.</hi> D. Whit. anſwers that this Canon mentioned by<note n="(m)" place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> Socrates, is not rightly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: he ſayth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth not ſignify <hi>celebrare Concilia, to hold Synods,</hi> as Caſſiodorus hath ill tranſlated it, whoſe tranſlation they abuſe; nor yet <hi>Eccleſias conſecrare, to conſecrate Churches,</hi> as Illyricus doth amiſſe tranſlate it, but <hi>leges Eccleſiaſticas ſancire, et canones Eccleſiis praeſcribere, to ordaine Eccleſiaſticall lawes, &amp; to preſcribes Canons unto Churches.</hi> And being thus tranſlated, he ſayth, <hi>We acknowledge &amp; approve this Canon, as moſt juſt. For reaſon itſelf teacheth &amp; telleth, that that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth all, ought to be approved of all. Therefore it was meet that thoſe Canons which ſhould be generall, ſhould be approved alſo of the Biſhop of Rome, who was one of the chief Biſhops.</hi> Now if D. Whita. allow that Canon to be moſt juſt, which grants unto Synods an authority of making Eccleſiaſticall lawes and enjoyning the Churches to keep them, then it is manifeſt hereby that he confeſſed the juriſdiction of Synods, and that they were not onely for counſell &amp; admonition.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſame place D. Whitak.<note n="(n)" place="margin">P. 45, 46</note> relates how the Biſhops of the Orientall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:112189:88"/>Churches meeting together in a Synod at Antioch, did by common ſentence write unto <hi>Iulius</hi> the Biſhop of Rome, and by way of rebuke ſayd unto him, that <hi>they were not to be overruled by him, that if they would caſt any out of their Churches,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>that ſuch ought not to be reſtored of him, even as thoſe whom he caſt out could not be reſtored of them.</hi> Although D. Whit. acknowledge the errours and faults of ſome that were in that Synod, yet he approveth this their writing in reproof of Julius, and ſayth, <hi>they all did gravely rebuke his arrogance &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.</hi> Though that Synod abuſed their power in cenſuring Athanaſius unjuſtly, yet that they had a power of cenſure, &amp; caſting out of their Churches, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but maintained againſt the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third Queſtion is touching the perſons whereof Synods doe conſiſt. Here D. Whit.<note n="(o)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci. Qu. 3. c. 1.</note> firſt deſcribes the Popiſh opinion, and reckons up the foure ſorts of perſons, whom they allow to come unto Synods, namely, that <hi>Some are preſent as judges, who have a determining voyce: Others, to diſpute and examine difficulties, and theſe have a conſultative voyce: Others, to defend the Synod, and to ſee that peace be kept within &amp; without: Others, to ſerve as notaries, watchmen, ſervants.</hi> Then he ſhewes that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>onely the greater Prelates, that is, all Biſhops and Archbiſhops to have the right of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining voyce in univerſall and particular Synods ordinarily, but that Cardinals, Abbots, Generalls of Orders, though they be not Biſhops, yet by extraordinary priviledge may alſo have a determining ſuffrage: as for all others whatſoever they be, they may be profitable, but not have a determining voyce or ſuffrage.</hi> After this he ſhewes the opinion of the Proteſtants, that not onely the greater Prelates, but whatſoever learned and godly men are ſent, being choſen by the Churches of ſeverall Provinces, and judged fit for that buſines, <hi>ought to have equall authority in giving ſuffrages,</hi> and ſo to be judges as well as any others. But had D. Whit. bene of my oppoſites minde, he ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned each of theſe opinions, both of Papiſts and Proteſtants, and ſhould have ſayd that neither one nor other ſorts of perſons were to be admitted for judges in Synods, but onely for counſellours and admoniſhers: that none of them were to have determining voyces or to give definitive ſentence, but onely to ſhew their adviſe, &amp; to have a conſultative voyce.</p>
                  <p>When Bellarmine alledgeth that the Prelates onely, as being Paſtours of the Church are to have definitive voyces; D. Whit. anſwering his arguments, ſayth,<note n="(p)" place="margin">Ibid. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The end of Synods is not to feed,</hi> viz. by teaching as proper paſtours, <hi>but to decide controverſies, to preſcribe Canons, to correct abuſes, to order Churches, and to doe other things, which belong unto the peaceable and quiet ſtate of the Church.</hi> Herein he yeelds unto Synods not onely adviſe for direction, but juriſdiction and power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To prove this authority of Preſbyters or Elders, he alledgeth <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. where there is mention of the decrees, ordained by the Apoſtles and Elders, and ſayth thereupon,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 3. p. 96. 97.</note> 
                     <hi>Who dare now denye the Elders to have had a determining ſuffrage? They did not onely diſpute or conſult, but did alſo judge and decree together with the Apoſtles. For the word,</hi>

                     <hi>is equally applyed unto both. Theſe things are ſo manifeſt that no man can gainſay it,</hi> To this end alſo he argueth<note n="(r)" place="margin">P. 102. 103.</note> that <hi>a Generall Synod repreſents
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:112189:88"/>the Vniverſall Church:</hi> that <hi>whoſoever is ſent of a Church, repreſents the perſon of that Church.</hi> And finally<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">P. 103, 104, &amp;c.</note> from ancient hiſtories he alledgeth the examples of divers Synods, as of Chalcedon, Nice, and Conſtantinople, wherein this power &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction was exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> A fourth Queſtion is about the Praeſident of Synods. In this diſpute, Bellarmine alledging that <hi>Conſtantine profeſsed himſelf to be ſubject unto the Biſhops, and that he ought to be judged of them;</hi> D. Whitaker allowing and commending that profeſſion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth and ſayth,<note n="(t)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. q. 4. c. 3. p. 132.</note> 
                     <hi>What then? This hindereth not but that he might be Praeſident. For if a Biſhop had bene Praeſident, ought be not to have bene judged of other Biſhops? What godly Prince would not have ſayd ſo?</hi> Hereby he acknowledgeth, that juriſdiction &amp; authority of judgement is no undue power of Synods, and that even the worthieſt perſons ought to be ſubject thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> A fift Queſtion is whether Synods be above the Pope. Here D. Whitaker ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt ſhewed what the Popiſh opinion is, he then declares the opinion of the Proteſtants, and ſayth,<note n="(v)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. q. 5. c. 1. p. 146.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeing the Pope is the Biſhop onely of one Church, he is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſuperiour unto all Biſhops aſſembled together, but not ſo much as ſuperiour unto any of them apart. Therefore we ſay that a Synod may alſo decree againſt the will of the Pope, may take cognition of the Popes cauſe, may judge the Pope, &amp; compell him unto order, may preſcribe lawes unto the Pope, which are to have force againſt his will, and finally may condemne the Pope and deprive him of his office, if he be worthy of ſuch a puniſhment.</hi> Now if a Synod have this power to judge, cenſure and depoſe the Popes, then hath it as much power to judge and cenſure other Miniſters and members of other Churches, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it can be ſhewed that they have more authority then the Pope, or ſome ſtrange priviledge to exempt them from that juriſdiction of Synods, whereunto others are in ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 3</note> he brings 10 Arguments to prove the ſuperiority of Synods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Pope. And in them there be plenteous evidences touching the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Synods. Thoſe arguments which prove that the Synods have juriſdiction over the Pope and power to cenſure him, doe alwayes prove that Synods have juriſdiction and power of cenſure. Otherwiſe, though the Pope deſerved cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet it ſhould be an uſurpation in the Synod, to doe that for which they had no calling nor warrant: even as in the execution of Civill judgments, it ſhould be a preſumptuous and unlawfull uſurpation, if private men being no Magiſtrates ſhould take upon them to puniſh malefactours, though they had juſtly deſerved the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Not to inſiſt upon many other things which out of thoſe 10 Arguments might be alledged for our purpoſe, I will onely inſtance in one example that is there<note n="(y)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 195. 196.</note> urged by D. Whitaker, and taken out of Sozomen, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15, <hi>or as in ſome editions,</hi> c. 14. who recordes that the Synod of <hi>Syrmium</hi> made an Act, whereby <hi>Foelix</hi> the Biſhop of Rome was appoynted to admit <hi>Liberius</hi> to be his fellow in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Romane Church. Hence D. Whitak. inferres, <hi>So it ſeemed good unto the Synod: therefore the Synod was above the Pope and above that Church.</hi> Bellarmine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>The Synod did not command, but onely exhort Foelix by letters, that he would ſuffer Liberius to ſit with him.</hi> D. Whit. replyes againe, <hi>Touching letters of exhortation, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:112189:89"/>makes no mention of them. He ſayth onely,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>They write unto Foelix,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that theſe letters were mandatory it appeares, becauſe otherwiſe Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix would never have yeelded.</hi> Thus we ſee from hence, that Synods have power (at leaſt in the judgement of D. Whit.) not onely to exhort &amp; admoniſh, which every Chriſtian may doe, but alſo to preſcribe &amp; injoyne that which is equall &amp; juſt, and ſo that others are to be ſubject thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> The ſixt and laſt Queſtion is, whether Synods can erre. Now leſt any ſhould take occaſion hereby to deny the authority of Synods, it is to be obſerved, that D. Whitaker doth in like manner affirme, that any lawfull aſſembly, even of thoſe that are met together in the name of Chriſt,<note place="margin">(z) De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. q. 6. c. 2. p. 216.</note> may erre alſo. He ſayth, (a) <hi>Though Christ be in the midſt of them which are aſſembled in his name, it followes not, that they doe not erre: For all are not free from errour with whom Chriſt is preſent. And truely two or three which meet in the name of Chriſt, may be deceived, may erre in many things, and may aſke thoſe things which are not to be aſked, and ſo be diſappointed of their hope, and yet Christ be among them. For Chriſt doth not alwayes exempt them from errour, with whom he is.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing every Eccleſiaſticall aſſembly, every Elderſhip, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, being ſubject to errour, and erring often, are not yet deprived of their juriſdiction and power in the judgement of cauſes: ſo though Synods want infallible judgement, and erre ſometimes, yet are they not therefore without ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and authority. But further he avoucheth plainly that Synods have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall authority, when he ſayth,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 3. p. 322.</note> 
                     <hi>A Synod is ſayd to doe lawfully, not onely when it condemneth and excommunicateth thoſe which are to be condemned &amp; pronounced Anathema, but alſo when it ordaines and maintaines thoſe decrees which agree with the Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> Had he bene of my oppoſites opinion he ſhould have ſayd the contraty, viz. that a Synod may not lawfully excommunicate or condemne thoſe that deſerve to be condemned, but onely admoniſh them, and ſo leave them to others. Yea he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds further, &amp; ſayth concerning Generall Synods, that<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 270.</note> 
                     <hi>In them is a ſoveraigne power, and they have the higheſt authority in the Church.</hi> He doth not onely grant unto them juriſdiction, but greater then is in any particular Church, or in any other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall judicatory.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas Bellarmine maintaines that Synods cannot erre when they are approved and confirmed of the Pope, and that all their authority depends u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him; hereupon D. Whita. argueth thus againſt him:<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 1. p. 214.</note> 
                     <hi>If there be ſuch weight in the Pope, that without him neither Provinciall nor Generall Synod have in them any force, it may worthily be demanded, what part the Biſhops have in a Synod, whether they be onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhers or counſellours, or whether they be judges? for if they be counſellours onely, why are none but Biſhops admitted unto Synods? why not others rather who are more learned then Biſhops? &amp;c.</hi> He notes it as a poynt of great abſurdity, and as a great ſtrait where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Papiſts are brought, againſt their will &amp; againſt their profeſſion, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould have no other place in Synods but of admoniſhers and counſellours. For indeed what uſe is their of ſuffrages, of definitive and determining voyces, if in the end all be determined by the Pope? why might not adviſes and counſels have ſufficed in ſuch caſe? This obſervation D. Whitaker holds to be of ſpeciall uſe, and worthy to be remembred, and therefore repeats it oft.<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibi. c. 2. p. 221, 222.</note> 
                     <hi>What place</hi> (<hi>I

                        </gap> end doe they meet? Is it that they may judge, or is it that they may onely counſell and admoniſh? Are they therefore judges, or are they onely admoniſhers &amp; counſellours? This indeed ſome of them thinke, that they may onely admoniſh in Synods, that they may move queſtions and diſpute, but may not judge. Naclantus Biſhop of Clug (as we taught before) in his treatiſe de poteſtate Papae &amp; Concilii, ſayth.</hi> The power of the Pope is royall, the power of the Synod is <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaria,</hi> by way of counſell; the power of the Pope is altogether definitive, the power of the Synod is of ambulatory definition, <hi>that is, as I interpret it, wandring &amp; uncertaine. Bellarmine indeed, and the Ieſuites that now are, hold that the Biſhops are jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but doubtles they meane an ambulatory judgement, that is, none at all. For indeed they give all judgement unto the Pope alone.</hi> Now this abſurd opinion which he notes to have bene the conceit of Naclantus, expreſſed in plaine words, and of Bellarmine and other Papiſts by conſequence, is even the ſame that is profeſſed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jacob, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cann. for though they differ in reſpect of the power of the Pope, yet in reſpect of the power belonging to Synods, they make the perſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Synods conſiſt, to be no other then admoniſhers or counſellours, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any juriſdiction at all. D. Whitaker yet leaves it not thus, but ſpeaking againe of the Popes over-ruling of Synods, he doth againe record this obſervation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 3. p. 267.</note> 
                     <hi>Certainly this is that which we ſayd before, that Biſhops aſſembled in a Synod, are not judges, but onely admoniſhers, that the Pope alone is judge of all controverſies, that the reſt have no authority. For if Biſhops were judges, judgement ſhould be done according to the greateſt number, and the ſentence of the moſt judges ſhould prevaile.</hi> We may think that D. Whitaker was guided by a ſpeciall providence of God, and directed by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thus particularly and remarkably aforehand to poynt out and commend to our conſideration this evill conſequent of making Synods to be onely admoniſhers or counſellours; that ſo we might have his writing for a Teſtimony againſt this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which within a while after was to be broached &amp; made common by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and ſome others; that which the Browniſts had done before, being neither ſo commonly knowne nor regarded.</p>

                  <p>In handling the firſt Queſtion, whereas the Papiſts require a Monarch to keep inferiour Officers in order and unity, D. Whitaker ſayth,<note n="(f)" place="margin">De Pont. Rom. q. 1. c. 2. p. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>If any will not doe their duety, and diſcharge their office, they are to be admoniſhed and rebuked, and except they obey,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:112189:90"/>they are at length to be remooved by the judgement of the Church, or the Synod, or the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate: and there are knowne meanes enough of keeping Miniſters in their duety, and the Church in unity, without a Pope.</hi> He acknowledgeth that Synods have not onely power to admoniſh, which every Chriſtian may doe, but after admonition to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure &amp; remove or depoſe the obſtinate.</p>

                     <hi>This equalls alſo may doe. So of old, if any Elder or Biſhop was accuſed, the Biſhops brought the matter unto an Eccleſiaſticall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Synod, and if he did ſeeme worthy of it, they condemned him by a publick judgement, that is, they eyther ſuſpended, or excommunicated, or depoſed him.</hi> He declares<note n="(h)" place="margin">P. 48. &amp; 49.</note> that the Church hath bene preſerved in greateſt tempeſts and troubles by Synods, and commends them for their uſe of juriſdiction in judging of cauſes, and ſhewes how thoſe that would not yeeld unto ſuch authority, were removed from their places, and others amended by their examples. He ſayth,<note n="(i)" place="margin">P 92.</note> 
                     <hi>Though one alone could not judge of another, yet a Synod, and as it were a Senate or Seſſion of Biſhops hath had the right and power to take cognition and judge of their cauſes.</hi> He obſerveth againe out of Cyprian,<note n="(k)" place="margin">P. 93.</note> 
                     <hi>No Biſhop could be judge of another: of another (I ſay) not of others, becauſe a Synod of Biſhops could alwayes judge a Biſhop: therefore the Monarchicall primacy of the Romane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is of no divine right.</hi> As he doth fully condemne the uſurpation of one Biſhop above another, ſo by way of oppoſition he doth fully and plentifully avouch the authority of many, meeting together in Synods, not onely for counſell &amp; admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, but for juriſdiction in judging &amp; cenſuring of offendours.</p>

The quotation of this Teſtimony is imperfectly deſcribed, ſo that men cannot finde the ſame, by the direction he gives, there being many ſecond bookes in thoſe 4 Tomes of that great work, each of them contayning many chapters, and none of them ſpecifyed by him.

                  <p>But that it may further appeare how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. is condemned by his owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is to be conſidered touching this famous light of Gods Church, that as he<note n="(z)" place="margin">Epiſt.

Chamierus</hi> after his fathers death dedicated that work unto the excellent and faythfull ſervants of God, the Paſtours and Elders of the French Churches aſſembled in a Nationall Synod, comparing them to <hi>the threeſcore valiant men of the valianteſt in Iſrael, compaſſing the bed of Salomon, all holding ſwords, expert in warre, every man with his ſword upon his thigh: becauſe of feare in the night; Sol. ſong, c.</hi> 3.7, 8. and as againe ſpeaking of the Synod, he applyes unto them that which is ſayd of the <hi>Tower of David,</hi> where the ſhields of the mighty men are hanged up, &amp;c. <hi>Sol. ſong,</hi> 4.4. ſo in the book itſelf there are many ample and pregnant teſtimonies touching the authority &amp; juriſdiction of Synods.</p>

                     <hi>The government of Churches is either of ſeverall Churches, or of many together,</hi> viz. by Synods. In both he maintaines an Ariſtocracie or juriſdiction of many.

                     <hi>For the diſpoſing and directing of publick affaires, Provinciall Synods were appointed, that is, companies of Biſhops in the ſame Province, which were aſſembled ſo often as need &amp; commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required.</hi> For evidence thereof he alledgeth divers Canons, &amp; commendeth Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian for obſerving that order.</p>
                  <p>Touching the adminiſtration of all Churches in the world, he ſayth;<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He that denyeth theſe to have bene governed by Vniverſall Synods, muſt be either notoriouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, or ignorant of all antiquity. For in the very beginnings, when a great queſtion was rayſed about the rites of Moſes, and ſome would have thoſe that were converted from heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idolatry, to be ſubjected unto them, Luke teſtifyeth that a Synod was aſſembled, Act.</hi> 15.

                  <p>It ſeemes alſo that this was the place from whence M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker took that which he alledged out of <hi>Chamierus,</hi> becauſe in theſe two chapters, 7. &amp; 8. are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe teſtimonies which he citeth. And here it is that he ſpeakes of <hi>cauſa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis,</hi> or the common cauſe, which Cyprian would have to be judged by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. And here it is that he ſpeakes of ſome proper cauſes, belonging peculiarly to ſome Biſhops in their ſpeciall charges, viz. c. 7. But theſe things are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſquoted by Mr Dav. by putting the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> book for the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, but the ſenſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, while Chamierus comparing Biſhops with Metropolitanes, reſtraines ſome things from Metropolitanes to ſuch Biſhops as had divers countries under them. And though he ſhew how Cyprian brought a common cauſe unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, yet he doth not affirme that onely ſuch common cauſes were to be brought unto Synods. Chamierus doth not witneſſe that <hi>the power of every particular Church is chief in its owne particular matters,</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D. alledgeth him for witneſſe thereof. And in c. 8. he brings many evidences to witneſſe the power of Generall Synods in judging the cauſes of all Churches.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the Queſtion whether the Biſhop of Rome may be judged of any, Chamierus ſhewes the opinion of the Proteſtants, whom he calleth Catholicks in oppoſition to the Papiſts, that<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid. l. 13. c. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>No Biſhop at all may by divine right be judged of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but of many, to wit in a Synod, ſo as it hath moſt often bene done.</hi> And when Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine objected the examples of ſome Synods, that refuſed to judge the Biſhop of Rome, Chamierus anſwereth, that ſome of them were <hi>particular Synods, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting onely of ſuch as were under the Romane. Therefore they could make no generall decree; but could onely ordaine that the Biſhop of Rome ſhould not be judged of them aſſembled in a particular Synod: which certainely they either did not ſpeak concerning a Generall Synod, or els they ſpoke falſely.</hi> A plaine confeſſion of the juriſdiction of Synods: for had he ſpoken of counſell or admonition onely, why might not any one particular Biſhop or Synod have admoniſhed the Pope upon occaſion, and given their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe touching him?</p>

For the juriſdiction of Synods in receiving appeales is in the ſame place as plainly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the juriſdiction of the Pope is denyed by their prohibition of appeales to be made unto him.</p>
                  <p>Againe when he proves that the Pope is ſubject to Eccleſiaſticall judgement, he doth in the ſame queſtion with one conclude that there is a ſuperiority of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and juriſdiction in Synods to judge of him.

He ſayth further, <hi>Even as particular Synods doe binde all the Biſhops within their owne juriſdiction, ſo Vniverſal Synods have power over all the Biſhops of the whole world.

                  <p>To conclude, whereas <hi>Chamierus</hi> was tranſlated out of this life, before he had fully finiſhed that great work of his <hi>Panſtratia Catholica;</hi> and therefore for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of it there is added unto his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Tome, a Supplement by <hi>Alſtedius;</hi> in that Supplement there is alſo a plaine confeſſion touching the authority of Synods.

                  <hi>If thoſe Churches, planted by the Apoſtolique inſtitution, had power fully in themſelves immediately from Chriſt, to practiſe all his ordinances: Then have all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the like power now. But the firſt is true: Therefore the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Propoſition is cleare &amp; certaine, by theſe Scriptures,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANSVV. I. The firſt maine fault in this Argument, common to many that follow, is, that herein is committed a foule fallacy, <hi>ab ignoratione Elenchi;</hi> that is to ſay, the Concluſion is beſide the Queſtion. This whole argument being granted, yet the authority of Synods remaines ſtill firme, and unſhaken thereby. When or where did I ever affirme that the Churches now have not the like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to practiſe all the ordinances of Chriſt, as fully as thoſe Churches planted by Apoſtolick inſtitution? The teſtimonies of learned men here alledged by him, to prove that the ancient and firſt inſtitutions are to be preferred before later inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I doe willingly aſſent unto. But what can he conclude hence? Though Chriſt have committed power unto a particular Church, doth it therefore follow that if ſuch abuſe their power and goe aſtray, either wholy or the greater part of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:112189:93"/>it, there is then no Eccleſiaſticall authority above them, to cenſure them or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them from proceeding in evill? This conſequence which had bene to the purpoſe, he offers not to prove. It was confeſſed<note n="(b)" place="margin">Chap. 5. ſect. 1. p. 81.</note> before b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mr Cartwright,</hi> one of his owne witneſſes here alledged by him, that <hi>if any Church ſhould deſire or chooſe, or conſent upon by the moſt part, ſome that is unmeet, either for doctrine or manners, then the Miniſters and Elders of other Churches round about, ſhould advertiſe first, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as occaſion ſhould ſerve, ſharply &amp; ſeverely charge, that they forbeare ſuch election, or if it be made, that they confirme it not, by ſuffering him to exerciſe any miniſtery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond extraordinary and groſſe errour is to be obſerved in his Logick, while in the proſequution of his Argument, he not knowing which is the <hi>Major</hi> or which is the <hi>Minor propoſition</hi> in his owne Syllogiſme, that which ſhould be for the proofe of his <hi>Minor propoſition,</hi> that he applyes for proofe of the <hi>Major;</hi> that which ſhould ſerve for proofe of his <hi>Major,</hi> that he brings for confirmation of his <hi>Minor.</hi> The Scriptures which he alledgeth, he referres to the proofe of his miſ-named <hi>Propoſition:</hi> the Teſtimonies of Authors here alledged, he referres to the proofe of his miſ-called <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> This errour I doe the rather note. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no ſlip or overſight in him through want of attention in this place, but an ordinary and frequent errour, as appeares in that which followeth. 2. Becauſe of his inſolent and arrogant boaſting againſt others,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Churc. plea, p. 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 15. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſ. of Sep. p. 188, 189.</note> for want of art, and want of wit, of Logick, &amp;c. Who can relate unto us ſuch an example of a man profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf a Logicall Diſputant, with ſuch abundance of printed Syllogiſmes, with ſuch contempt of others, and yet to be ſo rude, as not to know the plaineſt things and the A. B. C. in Logick, the difference betwixt the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> in a Syllogiſme? 3. Becauſe of his ſpirituall pride, not onely in ſeparating himſelf from the Churches of Chriſt, as other Browniſts doe, but taking upon him to be their Paſtour, their guide, their champion for defence of their Separatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt all men. O miſerable men, that follow ſo blinde a guide!</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third errour in the proſequution of this Argument is this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the premiſſes of this argument being rightly underſtood, are granted to be true; yet the Scriptures alledged doe not prove the ſame. Though the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches planted of the Apoſtles, had power fully in themſelves immediately from Chriſt, to practiſe all his ordinances; yet theſe places, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. doe onely prove their right for the practiſe of ſome of his ordinances, that are mentioned and poynted at in them, but not of all other. As for example; the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, though a right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church, and ordained in other places of Scripture, yet is not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed in any of theſe allegations. The liberty of appeales in caſe of oppreſſion, the power of ſending Deputies unto a Synod for the deciſion of difficult &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cauſes, are ordinances of Chriſt, and rights of the Church, as hath bene ſhewed before, &amp; yet not ſpecifyed in any of theſe Scriptures alledged by him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his proof for all ordinances is defective.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For the right underſtanding of this ſentence; viz. that <hi>every Pariſh or every particular Church hath full or ſufficient authority within it ſelf, derived immediately from Chriſt, for the government of it ſelf in all Eccleſiaſticall cauſes:</hi> I deſire the Reader to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:112189:93"/>look back unto the explication thereof by<note n="(d)" place="margin">Diſſe de Gub. Eccl. p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Gerſom Bucerus,</hi> who labouring to make the beſt interpretation thereof, yet ſhewes that it is not to be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divers cautions, ſome whereof I have expreſſed<note n="*" place="margin">P. 117. 118.</note> before. He undertakes the defence hereof againſt D. Downam, but no further then it may be ſo underſtood, and ſo expounded, as not containing in it any denyall or impeachment of the authority and juriſdiction of Claſſes and Synods, judging the cauſes of many Churches. And indeed how can any Church be ſayd to practiſe all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, ſo long as they refuſe and deny the combination of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or the juriſdiction of them being combined, which is ſhewed to be one of his ordinances?</p>
               <p>ARGVM. II.<note n="(e)" place="margin">Churc. plea, p. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>If Chriſt in Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>where he ſayth,</hi> Tell the Church; <hi>doth meane a particular Congregation: Then hath every particular Congregation, an intire power, in, &amp; of it ſelf, to exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall government, and all other Gods ſpirituall ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But the firſt is true: Therefore the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Propoſition is cleare and certaine, maintained by the moſt Iudicious Divines, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſumption is proved thus: That Church which Chriſt intendeth in Matt.</hi> 18. <hi>hath abſolute power in, &amp; of itſelf to performe all Gods ordinances: But Chriſt intendeth in Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>a particular Congregation: Therefore every particular Congregation hath abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in, and of it ſelf, to performe all Gods ordinances, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSVV. I. Here is the ſame fault that was in the former Argument, viz. of concluding beſide the queſtion. This argument being granted, there ariſeth hence no prejudice to the authority of Claſſes or Synods. The authority of particular Churches and the authority of Synods may well ſubſiſt together. The arrowes which are ſhot by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne are beſide the marke of the maine queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. His argument is not onely beſide the mark, but as an arrow ſhot up into the ayre, and falling downe on his head againe, ſo doth his argument returne upon himſelf: for if a particular Church hath intire power, in and of itſelf to performe all Gods ordinances; then hath it power to unite itſelf with other Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in Synods, and to ſubmit unto the judgement thereof, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine warrant &amp; ordinance. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 17.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. As before, ſo he blindely ſtumbles here againe at the ſame ſtone, in not diſcerning betwixt the Propoſition and Aſſumption of his owne Syllogiſme. The Authors which he alledgeth for the maintenance of his <hi>Major propoſition,</hi> ought to have bene applyed to the proofe of his <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> viz. to ſhew that <hi>Christ in Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>where he ſaith,</hi> Tell the Church, <hi>doth meane a particular Congregation:</hi> for this is that which he aſſumes, when he ſayth, <hi>But the firſt is true.</hi> And all the ſhew of help which he hath from his Authors, tends to confirme this Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but their teſtimonies are no direct proofe of his Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Another new groſſe errour in his Logicall diſpute, is this, that whereas he goes about to prove the Aſſumption of his firſt Syllogiſme, by framing a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Syllogiſme, he doth not therein according to order conclude that which was his former Aſſumption, whether it be underſtood as it is indeed, or as he miſcalles it; but inſtead thereof he ridiculouſly repeates the Concluſion of his firſt Syllogiſme, which Concluſion is neither the Propoſition nor the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:112189:94"/>which he offers to prove; but the Queſtion made by him in his maine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. And thus entangling himſelfe with his owne Syllogiſmes, Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Aſſumptions, he hath brought himſelf into ſuch a maze, that he knowes not where he is, what he ſayth, nor whereof he affirmeth. Let Logicians tell how oft they have ſeene the like in print.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Whether all his Authors doe affirme that by the Church in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. Chriſt meant a particular Congregation, I will not here examine: I ſhall have further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in the next chapter to ſpeak of many of them. But in the meane time let it be granted, not onely that they have all ſo affirmed, but that it is the trueth: Yet doe they not all affirme, that <hi>onely</hi> a particular Congregation was intended by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. For both the Elderſhip of a particular Church, and the Synod ariſing from the combination of many Churches, are ſhewed unto us in <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. the one for the judging of leſſer cauſes, without bringing them to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; the other for the deciding of weightier matters, which neither El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip nor Congregation can ſo well end. And this is acknowledged by ſundry of his Witneſſes, whoſe names he abuſeth in this controverſy. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Mat. 18. ſayth,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pol. Eccl. l. 3. c. 15. p. 160.</note> 
                  <hi>The Church of the faythfull is intended of Christ, not as it is ſimply conſidered (as we ſayd before) but as it exerciſeth Diſcipline according to an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall temperament in the Elderſhip. For we doe think that the Church mentioned in the firſt place, in thoſe words,</hi> Tell the Church, <hi>doth preciſely ſignify the Ariſtocraticall part, that is, the Elderſhip: but that which is mentioned in the latter place, in theſe words,</hi> If he heare not the Church, <hi>if (as Downame teacheth) it include the Church excommunicating for contempt, and not onely decreeing or examining, then it doth alſo comprehend the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall part of the Church, foraſmuch as the conſent of the people is neceſſary unto excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And a little before he ſayth<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 159.</note> 
                  <hi>Almoſt all interpreters doe agree, that thoſe words</hi> [<hi>in verſ.</hi> 19.] If two or three, <hi>doe containe an amplification from the leſse to the greater, from a leſse company to a greater: ſo that it is moſt plaine, that under the name of the Church he included as well the greater company, as that which conſiſts of two or three.</hi> How M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker proved the Synod alſo from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. is ſhewed<note n="(h)" place="margin">See Ch. 3. p. 45. 49.</note> before; where D. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cartwright and others alſo teach the ſame thing.</p>

                  <hi>Whatſoever was commanded to the</hi> 7 <hi>Churches to be practiſed by each of them, apart, in, and for themſelves; that no Church of God muſt now omit. But Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall government, was commanded to the</hi> 7 <hi>Churches to be practiſed by each of them, apart, in, and for themſelves. Therefore no Churches of God muſt omit the practiſe of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall government, apart, in, and for themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Propoſition cannot be doubted of. For as Chytraeus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſumption is proved clearly in chap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 14, 20. <hi>&amp;c. Moreover Mr Perkins, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSVV. I. This Argument for the forme of it, is a miſſhapen Syllogiſme, and that in a double reſpect; both becauſe the <hi>Minor terminus</hi> is ſuperfluouſly put into the <hi>Major Propoſition;</hi> and becauſe the ſame <hi>terminus</hi> is confuſedly joyned with the <hi>Praedicate</hi> in the <hi>Minor propoſition,</hi> when it ſhould have bene placed with the <hi>Subject</hi> therein. But this is one of the leaſt faults in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes reaſonings.</p>
               <p n="2">II. For the matter of it, this Argument doth alſo come ſhort of the mark, &amp;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:112189:94"/>reacheth not home to the queſtion. And that which he concludes (being well underſtood) may be ſafely granted of us. That which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne alledgeth from Chytraeus, Bullinger, Brightman &amp; Perkins, for the proof of his Propoſition &amp; Aſſumption, I doe willingly aſſent unto, and it was but an idle labour to bring them for proof of that which is not denyed. There be no Churches here among us which refuſe to practiſe Eccleſiaſticall government, <hi>apart, in &amp; for themſelves.</hi> This they practiſe after a double manner; 1. There be many rebukes and cenſures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne adminiſtred in them without the knowledge of Claſſis or Synod, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, in and for themſelves. 2. When as more hard &amp; weighty cauſes are brought unto the Deputies of other Churches, aſſembled in Claſſes, for their adviſe and judgement, even then alſo when upon their conſideration matters are cleared, and there remaineth no ſcruple, they are then remitted againe and referred unto the particular Churches, ſo that the Elderſhip with conſent of the Congregation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth therein as they finde cauſe, according to the repentance or obſtinacy of the perſons with whom they have to deale: And ſo the ſentence is both determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed apart, in &amp; for themſelves, without the Claſſis.</p>
               <p>But if by government to be practiſed <hi>apart, in and for themſelves,</hi> he meane ſuch a ſolitary and ſeparate government, as refuſeth combination with other neighbour Churches, ſuch as admitteth no liberty of appeale in caſe of greateſt wrong, ſuch as excepteth a particular Congregation from the cenſure of all other Churches, though it ſhould erre never ſo perniciouſly, and in ſumme, ſuch a government <hi>apart,</hi> as denyeth all authority and juriſdiction of Claſſes and Synods; then is his Aſſumption moſt falſe: and all that he alledgeth for proofe thereof helpes him nothing. for 1. Though the Angel of the Church of Epheſus be commended for not bearing with the wicked, &amp;c. and the Angel of the Church of Pergamus and Thyatira be reprehended for ſuffering divers enormities, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.14.20. by what good conſequence can theſe examples overthrow the authority of Synods? There might be occaſion at this day to write unto ſome Miniſters ſtanding under the Claſſes and Synods in theſe Reformed Churches, and ſome of them might juſtly be commended for their zeale in not bearing with the wicked; others might juſtly be reprehended for their negligence in tolerating of ſuch as offend: now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne according to this reaſoning, might as well conclude, againſt experience, &amp; againſt the knowne trueth, that theſe Miniſters doe not ſtand under any Claſſicall government. 2. The praiſe or diſpraiſe which is given to the Angels of ſeverall Churches apart, doth not ſo much ſerve to argue an independency or diſunion in government in theſe Churches; but the very<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1.16.20. &amp; 2.1. &amp; 3.1.</note> forme of the viſion, in the union of theſe Starres of the Churches in Chriſts right hand, doth rather argue a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of them for their mutuall help in the government of his Church. They appeare not ſcattered in the Firmament, but gathered and drawne together. What is a Claſſis or Synod, but as a Conſtellation of ſo many Starres of the Churches combined together, which by their conjunction together doe yeeld both a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light of direction, and a ſtronger influence of authority, for the confirmation of the trueth and conviction of errour.</p>
               <p>And as for the teſtimony of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins, though he acknowledge,<note n="(k)" place="margin">Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rev. 2.20. &amp; 3.7</note> God

               <p>ANSVV. That which he ſo boldly affirmeth to be <hi>unqueſtionably certain,</hi> viz. that which is indeed the firſt part of this Argument, is on the contrary moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe. This conſequence of his <hi>Major propoſition</hi> remaines to be proved. Scripture he alledgeth none at all, and for thoſe eleven Authors mentioned by him, there is not one of them that confirmes his conſequence. Why did he not expreſſe their words, &amp; apply them to his purpoſe, &amp; enforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt us, if he thought they would have ſerved his turne? It is ſayd to have bene a ſtratageme of theeves, that to affright men they have taken many hats and ſet them upon ſtakes afarre of, that paſſengers imagining them to be men, &amp; partakers with thoſe theeves that came unto them, might the ſooner yeeld.

               <p>ANSVV. That which he ſaith here of <hi>ſole and alone authority, &amp;c.</hi> is more then he propounded in his Syllogiſme: I acknowledge that the Church of Corinth did exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall government within herſelf; and I affirme as much for our owne and other particular Congregations here: and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might argue that we doe not ſtand under Claſſes and Synods, if there were any ſoundnes in his Syllogiſme. My opinion touching the Church of Corinth may be diſcerned ſufficiently by that which I noted touching the 7 Churches, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his former argument. And as for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cartwright and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, whom he ſpecially alledgeth, they help him not at all. I acknowledge M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker doth juſtly oppoſe them that held, the Church of Corinth <hi>did not excommunicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon, but Apoſtle alone:</hi> But I doe more fully aſſent unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, who differing ſomething from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, and refuting the Rhemiſts moſt effectually by many reaſons, doth yet withall ſhew, that the authority and power both of the Apoſtle and of the Church did concurre in this excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

If then you will ſay, that the Churches judgement in excommunication is but to beare witneſſe: it followeth that the Apoſtles then, and conſequently their ſucceſſours now are onely to beare witneſſe of the excommunication. Hereunto commeth alſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of this cenſure is aſſcribed in the ſame word of</hi> forgivenes <hi>or abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto the Church as unto Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Now to have the ſame word in the ſame verſe and the ſame cauſe to be underſtood diverſly, and referred to Paul to have the proper ſignification of remitting, but referred to the Church to ſignify</hi> a witneſſing <hi>of remiſſion: needeth more learning for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, then falleth unto the Ieſuites capacity.</hi> Thus he ſhewes that neither the <hi>ſole authority</hi> of the Church on the one ſide, nor the <hi>ſole authority</hi> of Paul on the other ſide did determine this buſines.

               <p n="2">II.

Seeing there is no Ruler in his owne Company but himſelf, &amp; he denyes all other rule over him by Synods, doth he not make himſelf a kinde of Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> or ſole Governour of the Separation?</p>

               <p>ANSVV. I. This Argument concludes nothing againſt us, neither toucheth it the Queſtion. When did I ever ſpeake of any Synodicall offices? And what are thoſe Offices that here he intends? The members of Claſſes and Synods, are no other then the ordinary Officers or Deputies of particular Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering together and determining ſo as they judge beſt for the edification of their flockes.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If he imagine or conceive that the Praeſident which propoundeth matters in Synods, or the Scribe that recordeth them, be diſtinct Synodicall Officers; he might as well think, and we might as well ſay, that the Browniſts alſo had other diſtinct Eccleſiaſticall Offices, beſides Paſtours, Teachers, or Elders, namely Praeſidents and Scribes; becauſe heretofore in the dayes of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Iohnſon and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ainſworth, they with their Elders did by courſe propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d matters in their Church, &amp; had alſo a Scribe to write downe their ſpeciall buſineſſes: &amp; now in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes time, when they have no Elderſhip, if he alone propound matters and keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of them in writing, it may then be ſayd that he hath two or three Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offices, as well as ſo many Mechanicall trades.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If propounding of matters as the Praeſident, and writing them as the Scribe, doe conſtitute new offices; then many other members of the Browniſts Church, may be reputed for Eccleſiaſticall Officers; for Praeſidents and Scribes. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne being now their onely Governour, if it fall out that any among

               <p n="4">IV. That which he ſayth of Claſſes and Synods, that <hi>without them the Church of God is fully brought to complete perfection and unity,</hi> comparing them to Lordly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Chancellours, &amp;c. it is utterly falſe.

Though they be not abſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>being</hi> and ſubſiſtence of a Church, yet how needfull they are to the <hi>well-being</hi> of a Church, both thoſe Authors doe ſhew and prove from divers grounds of Scripture, noted before.

II. Had I ſpoken more largely of the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:112189:98"/>and conſent of the Claſſes and Synods, yet would not my teſtimony have proved his Minor, viz. that <hi>their government tends to the taking away from particular Churches their due power:</hi> ſeeing the authority and help of Claſſes tends to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of their due power, by directing and regulating the ſame, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the undue execution of their power. This order takes not away due power, but hinders and corrects onely the undue exerciſe of their power. Thus much is confeſſed by ſuch as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne himſelf hereafter calles for to be his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.

He ſhewes that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Claſſes and Synods as they now are, doth not take away the due power of particular Congregations. Touching the Churches of the Villages in theſe Netherlands, with whom we are united in the ſame government, he ſayth,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pol. Ecc. l. 3. c 23. p. 349.</note> 
                  <hi>The power of excommunication, ordination, and other juriſdiction,</hi> illis illibata relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, <hi>is left pure unto them, ſaving onely that communion which ought to be among Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: every Church uſeth the counſell and conſent of her neighbours, as of the Claſſis or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in the city, which I ſuppoſe not to be unmeet even for the moſt perfect Churches.</hi> He judged the freeſt and moſt perfect Churches to ſtand in need of this government, and that it was no empeachment of their due power. But M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne labours to illuſtrate his aſſertion with ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">I. CAN. <hi>For inſtance; ſay the Claſſes and Synods will not permit, that a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall reject ſome convicted Hereticks; then they must (if they will beleeve Mr Paget) let them alone in their communion, against Gods expreſſe commandement; Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>and ſo obey men rather then God. Againe put caſe, ſome Churches doe want Miniſters, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if the Claſſes and Synods will not give them leave, to chooſe any, except unfit and inſufficient perſons; then it ſeemes by this</hi> Synodicall Canon, <hi>they must take ſuch, or remaine deſtitute still.</hi> ANSVV. I. If ſuch ſtrange caſes, and unheared of in our times, ſhould fall out, that then ſuch oppreſſion and tyranny, is not to be imputed unto the Claſſicall or Synodall order &amp; government, but to the corruption &amp; perſonall wickednes of ſuch men as ſhould be members of the Claſſis or Synod. Such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall evills, not ſpringing from the nature of an ordinance, are no arguments to prove the unlawfulnes of an ordinance; when as the ordinance itſelf and in its owne nature ſerves for the preventing or remooving of ſuch evills in particular Churches. II. All the force of theſe objections, and all the feare of danger and inconvenience pretended by theſe inſtances comes as ſtrongly, yea &amp; much more heavily upon the heads of thoſe that ſtand for a ſingle, uncompounded policie, &amp; would have all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction limited unto a particular Congregation: for example, put caſe that the greater part of a particular Congregation, and of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:112189:98"/>the Elderſhip therein, will chooſe an offenſive and inſufficient Miniſter, or will not permit that an obſtinate and convicted Heretick among them ſhall be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; what ſhall the other part of the Church doe, which is oppreſſed and hindred from the due exerciſe of their power by the unrighteous proceeding of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part? What can follow here according to<note n="(g)" place="margin">H. Ainſ. Animadv. p. 39. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m. of Saints, c. 23. p. 470. 471.</note> the doctrine and practiſe of the Browniſts, but ſeparation, &amp; diſſipation of the Church? But by the government of Synods, if particular Churches be guilty of errour, oppreſſion and tyranny, their errour is to be corrected by Claſſes; if Claſſes erre, Synods may correct them; and one Synod may be corrected by another greater. And ſo many great evills may be redreſſed, and ſcandals remooved. III. As for the rejection of Hereticks, commanded <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. a principall meanes for the accompliſhment thereof, is the help of Claſſes and Synods, by their diſcerning, convincing and judging of them. If that help ſhould faile, and thoſe that have authority ſhould neglect or refuſe to doe their duety herein; the godly after teſtifying againſt evill, are to tolerate that which they cannot amend: even as the Phariſees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, convicted Hereticks, were tolerated by the godly, that remained in the Church without ſeparation. Laſtly, ſuppoſe that the power of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had bene in ſome ſort weakned, and not ſtrengthned by the government of Claſſes and Synods, as they now are; yet is it a groſſe falſhood, when he aſſumeth, or rather laviſhly preſumeth, that their government tends <hi>merely,</hi> or onely, to the taking away of the Churches due power; as though there were no other fruit or benefit by them. This he ſhall never prove.</p>
               <p>The ſecond proof of his Minor is taken from the practiſe of the Claſſis. W. Beſt is<note n="(h)" place="margin">Church. plea. p. 74.</note> there brought in complaining of the authority which they take over us and our Elderſhip too: <hi>yea in truth</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſo much authority as any Lord can doe over his ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> But this is a ſhameles and impudent falſhood, without trueth; for no Lords ſuffer their ſervants to ſit with them in judgement, and to have a voyce for determining matters as well as themſelves, ſo as the Elders or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every Church are allowed in the Claſſis. Beſide other manifeſt differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, obſerve the unbounded and unmeaſurable ſlander, in his ſpeaking not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that authority which Lords doe take, but of that which <hi>any Lord can</hi> doe over his ſervant. For what is it which the worſt Lord cannot doe to his ſervant?</p>
               <p>That inſufficient reaſon which he brings for the declaration of this authority, may as well and more truely, in his words be applyed unto the Democracy of the Browniſts: for <hi>ſo long as any member among them doth what that</hi> imperious company <hi>will have him doe, he is left alone; but if he meddle with things against the others liking, he is immediately commanded to ceaſe, and ſo muſt not proceed further.</hi> Yea that Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call judicatory is farre more ſevere and ready to cenſure thoſe that reſiſt them, then is any Claſſis in theſe lands. Had any member of them ſo behaved himſelf againſt them, as W. Be. hath done to the Claſſis in this ſcandalous and reproachfull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt them, as well as againſt me, he had bene long ſince delivered unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: he could not have exſpected ſuch lenity and patience from them, as the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis hath uſed towards this W.

               <p>My anſwer unto a writing, touching <hi>an action joyntly concluded</hi> by them, as he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:112189:99"/>ſaith, viz. that <hi>it did not belong unto them;</hi> is deceitfully and imperfectly ſet downe. The matter being ſuch as had bene already brought unto the Claſſis, and there judged and decided againſt them: there was no reaſon that it ſhould be brought back to an inferiour judicatory; being ſuch as were parties alſo; being ſuch parties alſo as had bene already cenſured about that controverſy. And ſee the dawbing between M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne and W.B. The concluſion ſpoken of, was not the concluſion of the Congregation; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne himſelf allowes not a Conſiſtory to make any ſuch concluſions without the Congregation; and by his profeſſion, <hi>it doth not belong</hi> unto a Conſiſtory; and yet he helps W.B. to exclaime for that, wherein he himſelf is of another minde.</p>
               <p>Touching the words of the Prophet, abuſed and miſapplyed by them to frame their complaint, <hi>Woe unto us, we are ſpoyled, Ier.</hi> 4.13. I anſwer: 1. The liberty of appeales unto Claſſes and Synods, is that which preſerveth a Church and the members thereof from being ſpoyled by any faction. And by their help, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy our liberty and peace; and are eſtabliſhed, and furniſhed with ſuch Miniſters, as agree with us in the trueth, and are endued with ſuch gifts as are meet for our edification. 2. On the contrary, for want of combination with Claſſes, <hi>Mr Can.</hi> may juſtly take up the complaint, <hi>Woe unto us we are ſpoyled:</hi> Since his comming unto them (beſide former diſſipations) their Church is rent in the midſt by incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contentions, their people ſcattered, he himſelf depoſed, and rejected by the Elders &amp; people; &amp; they mutually one half abandoning another, &amp; avoyding one anothers companies as excommunicates. Loe here a Spoyle.</p>
               <p>ARGVM. X. <hi>It is a ſinne againſt God, to adde any thing, to that forme and manner of ordering Churches, which Chriſt our heavenly Prophet, hath ſet forth unto us in the New Teſtament. To ſubject particular Congregations, under any other Eccleſiaſticall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, out of themſelves, is to adde unto that forme and manner of ordering Churches, which &amp;c. Therefore it is a ſinne to doe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Propoſition cannot be excepted against; for the Scriptures herein are evident, Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp;c. Many learned men, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Aſſumption cannot for ſhame be denyed; onely becauſe the weight of the controverſy leaneth upon it, I will ſpeak further of it in the next Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSVV. For the Propoſition, I. If it be well underſtood, I doe willingly grant it: And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne doth againe trifle, in alledging ſo many Scriptures, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, and other later Writers for the proof thereof. II. Both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other Writers alledged by him, doe as well condemne ſuch as take from the word of God, as thoſe that adde unto it. And therefore they ſerve to reprove M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can. that detracts from it by denying the authority of Synods, taught in the forementioned Scriptures, both of the Old and New Teſtament. The Kings coyne is adulterate, as well by clipping and diminiſhing the ſame, as otherwiſe. This crime are they guilty of, that clip the authority of Synods. III. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here mentioned doe give expreſſe teſtimony for Synods by ſpeciall &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular allowance of them, and therefore they are doubly abuſed, being thus alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt their meaning.</p>
               <p>For the Aſſumption, he incurreth a threefold ſhame. I. It is a bold and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:112189:99"/>ſhameles aſſertion for him to ſay, it <hi>cannot for ſhame be denyed;</hi> when as it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, and generally denyed by the moſt godly and learned in all ages. II. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhame it is, that though he here confeſſe, <hi>the weight of the controverſy leaneth upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it;</hi> yet here he brings nothing at all for the confirmation thereof. This is his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: where no need of proof is, there he idlie abounds with Scriptures, Fathers, and other Writers; where the poynt of difference is, on which the weight of the controverſy leaneth, there he leaves his Aſſumptions naked and without proof. III. It is a further ſhame, to put us off to the next Section, and to tell us he will there <hi>ſpeak further of it,</hi> where he onely alledgeth the teſtimonies of men. Is this anſwerable to the profeſſion of the Browniſts, that boaſt ſo much, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAving thus examined his Arguments, which he hath honoured with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of his Art, by propounding them in Syllogiſticall formes; we will now proceed to conſider another ſort of his Reaſons, to which he doth not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo much reſpect, but propounds them more careleſly and nakedly, without ſuch complete Logicall attire. Of theſe he ſayth, <hi>There are yet other reaſons to proove our Aſsertion; the which I will here lay downe more briefly.</hi>

                  <hi>If every Elderſhip have a like &amp; equall power, as Hierome, Cyprian, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and others affirme; then may not the Officers of one Congregation, ſeeke by authority to ſuppreſſe the acts and decrees concluded in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSVV. I. The conſequence of this reaſon is denyed by us. Though every Elderſhip be of equall power, yet the Miniſters and Elders of one Congregation, being joyned together in a Claſſis or Synod with the Deputies of many Churches, theſe may lawfully ſeek by their joynt authority, to ſuppreſſe any unlawfull acts or decrees of another Congregation. The reaſon is, becauſe as D. Whitaker<note n="(k)" place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. qu. 1. c. 3.</note> reaſoneth from <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.20. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker<note n="(l)" place="margin">Pol. Ecc. l. 3. c. 13. § 4.</note> alledgeth againe from him, <hi>Vis unita fortior, Power combined is the ſtronger.</hi> The concurrence of power from many Churches is the ground on Synodall and Claſſicall authority over particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, though otherwiſe in themſelves conſidered apart they be all equall. II. Note here againe the trifling and ſhifting of <hi>Mr Canne.</hi> To prove the equality of Elderſhips, he alledgeth the teſtimonies of <hi>Hierome, Cyprian, Bucer, and others:</hi> though I had before granted it, and ſhewed that in the Claſſis our Elderſhip had<note n="(m)" place="margin">Anſw. to W.

                  <hi>the ſame liberty and power in giving our voyces equally</hi> with others, and that our El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>have exerciſed as much authority as any member of the Claſſis, by giving their voyces for deciding, judging and determining any controverſy, &amp;c.</hi> yet needleſly he brings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Writers for proof of this confeſſed and practiſed trueth; and for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his moſt falſe conſequence he offers not to bring any proof at all, from any word of God or man.</p>
               <p>REAS. II. <hi>It is againſt ſence, that a Minister ſhould undertake the care of more Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches then one onely: who reads in Scripture of a ſteward over many families, a ſheep heard over divers flockes, &amp;c.</hi> Nature hath ordained (<hi>ſaith</hi>

               <p>ANSVV. I. We read in Scripture of Jaacob that was a ſhepherd over divers flockes, both of his owne and of Labans. <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.36, 40. II. We read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Apoſtles that were ſtewards and ſhepherds over divers flockes, having
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:112189:100"/>the care of all Churches, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>with</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.15, 16. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne ought at leaſt to have excepted extraordinary Shepherds. III. Though ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſtours or Miniſters have the peculiar and proper charge of no more then one flock; yet in regard of a common and joynt care of many Churches combined in Claſſes and Synods, we read in Scripture that the Elders and Shepherds of the Church in Ieruſalem did undertake the care, and exerciſe with others authority in judging the cauſe of the Church of Antioch. It is againſt ſenſe, againſt nature, againſt Scripture, but that the members of the body ſhould have <hi>care one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> IV. The uſe of Claſſes and Synods for counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is allowed by my oppoſites, and yet the care and labour therein, for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to meet in ſuch aſſemblies, for deliberation, for diſputing, for convincing ſuch as they admoniſh, and their counſell given unto Churches for the rejecting of Hereticks and other obſtinate offendours, more or leſſe, is as great in effect as if they ſhould give definitive ſentence therein. As little diſtraction ariſeth from one work as from the other. To counſell a Church to excommunicate a ſinner, is as great a burden and labour, for a Synod, as if they ſhould pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence themſelves. V. It doth leaſt of all become <hi>Mr Canne</hi> to plead and reaſon on this manner. If <hi>nature have ordained one to one,</hi> as he argueth out of Ariſtotle (though in his quotation he forgat to tell where) then muſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne be a man againſt nature, above many other, in tranſgreſſing the law and ordinance of nature. How durſt he take the Paſtorall charge of a Church upon him, and this alone without aſſiſtance of an Elderſhip, and yet in the meane time undertake the care and charge of divers other trades, as of a Printers work-houſe in one place, of a <hi>Brandery</hi> or Aquavitae ſhop in another place, and ſpecially of an Alchymiſts labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory in another place? Is this paragon of the Separation a fit man to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate or Patron of the Churches, to write a booke and intitle it <hi>the Churches plea,</hi> whereas if his example were followed, it would bring confuſion upon all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and on all the Miniſters thereof? What Pluraliſt or Non-reſident is there that will not thinke he hath ſome colour to juſtify himſelf from this practiſe of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne?</p>
               <p>REAS. III. <hi>Is it a like thing, that the Claſſicall power, ſhould be of Gods approving, and yet he never mention it in his word? This argument the Hierarchy uſe againſt Popiſh Offices; and the Reformiſts againſt theirs. Now let the diſcreet Reader judge, if it proove not the point in hand as well.

II. Note his errour of ſpeech in diſtinguiſhing the Hierarchy from Popiſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by oppoſing them one againſt the other; whereas according to the common acception of the word, the Hierarchy doth conſiſt in the Popiſh offices: and the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:112189:100"/>corruption of offices which he intends, is but a fragment thereof, and therefore ought not to carry the name rather then the whole, when both are ſpoken of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

And herein the Church of the Browniſts doth plainly reſemble the Pope; ſeeing their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation alſo, their Democraticall judicatory allowes no appeale to be made from them unto Claſſes or Synods, unto any Eccleſiaſticall judges beſides themſelves.

The vaſſallage and ſlavery which he argues from Claſſicall government, is upon a falſe conſequence.

The Democraticall government that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes this liberty of appeale, is no gracious miſtreſſe, but a Tyrannicall virago, reſembling the Romiſh Lady, that by denying appeales from the Pope keeps many in bondage.

               <p>ANSVV. 1. The conſequence propounded in this reaſon is falſe. Though the Apoſtles in the conſtitution of Churches, did immediately eſtabliſh Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall government therein; yet muſt it not needes follow, that they were <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent bodies &amp;c.</hi> For proof of this conſequence he brings nothing but his bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, neither Scripture, nor teſtimony of any learned Writer. To prove an eſtabliſhment of government in the primitive Churches at firſt, he idly and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly alledgeth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, and D.

Martyr, of D. Bilſon, of the Churches of France, of the Low-countries, of Scotland, and of Papiſts alſo: but to help his weak, unſound conſequence, that needed confirmation and ſupport, there is no proof, nor ſhew of proof. II. Though particular Churches in their ſeverall aſſemblies be acknowledged to be diſtinct bodies, yet in regard of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and full communion of Saints, they are all members of one body: there is but <hi>one body, Eph.</hi> 4.4. And thoſe that are members of one body are not indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Scriptures that ſhew this unity and the dueties ariſing from thence are juſtly alledged and layd downe as the ground of combination and conſociation of Churches. And this foundation of Claſſicall communion being as ancient as the firſt conſtitution of Churches, it appeareth hereby that the right of this confederation of churches was in them from the beginning, with liberty to uſe and exerciſe the ſame as occaſion and opportunity ſhould permit. <hi>Mr Cartwright</hi> being required to ſhew Scripture for the warrant of this practiſe of Churches, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <q>

For as in the body of one particular Church, every faithfull man compared with another in the ſame, is a member one of another: ſo in a more generall body of a whole Realme, every particular Church compared with other, is likewiſe a member of them. Therefore as nature teacheth my hand to help the diſorder which is in another part of my body: ſo the Spirit of God out of his word, through a fellow-feeling teacheth one Church, to ſtretch out her hand, to put away as it can, the evill which it ſeeth approch unto another.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.14 Heb. 3.13.</note> And therefore when the Scripture willeth that one ſhould admoniſh another, it is not onely a commandement to every ſingular man, towards his fellow: but alſo to one whole company, towards another ſocietie.</q>

The accord of Papiſts is no ſufficient reaſon for refutation; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they accord with us in many poynts of religion, againſt Arrians, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, and others. II. See the partiality of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne: in his eight Reaſon before, he alledgeth for himſelf how the Papiſts doe accord with him; <hi>to this the Papists aſſent,</hi> ſayth he; here in this place he alledgeth againſt me, their accord &amp; aſſent with me; preſently after againe, in the ſame and following pages, he <hi>doubts not but to make it manifest,</hi> that the Papiſts are <hi>with him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with him it muſt ſerve for the confirmation of his reaſon: when they accord with me, it muſt ſtill ſerve for confirmation of his reaſon, and for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of me. Whether it be their aſſent or diſſent, it is all one to him: he can ground his arguments upon one as well as the other. Such are his reaſonings. III. Mark his falſe allegation of Bellarmine, de Eccl. l. 5. c. 5. when as there is no ſuch fift booke extant, written by Bellarmine. IV.

                  <p>HAving promiſed to produce the Teſtimonies of <hi>Reverend and judicious Authors,</hi> as he calles them, he brings in the Papiſts and drawes out the Popiſh band in the firſt place againſt me.

                     <hi>Though you come againſt us with horſmen and charets; yet we will remember the name of the Lord our God, &amp;c.</hi> That which David ſpeakes of his refuge againſt the forces of the Heatheniſh Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. he applyes againſt theſe Worthies, which were indeed <hi>the horſemen and charets of Iſrael:</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.14. But that might I much more juſtly apply unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, that alledgeth againſt me, and ſo unjuſtly, ſuch a company of Romaniſts, the horſmen and charets of Antichriſt, the Locuſts like horſes prepared unto the battell. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.7.</p>
                  <p>And here firſt of all let it be conſidered what open wrong he doth unto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> &amp;c. in faining that they will not allow that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment now, which they acknowledge to have bene uſed of old; while he ſaith, <hi>Howſoever Romes-Champions will have none now to meddle with Church-government, but Prieſts, Biſhops, Prelates, &amp;c. yet they doe acknowledge that in the primitive Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the precept of Chriſt, in Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>offenders, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, were brought to the whole Congregation, &amp;c.</hi> This which he faineth to be granted by them, touching a diverſity of Government in reſpect of times, cannot be juſtly affirmed. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place<note n="(e)" place="margin">DeVer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei, l. 3. c. 5.</note> alledged by him, pleads for the ſame Government to be uſed now, which he ſhewes to have bene ordained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to that end he alledgeth 8 or 9 places of Scripture out of the new Teſtament, as grounds of the ſame Government. And in the<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ibid. c. 5</note> Chapter following he laboureth to prove that the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath bene ſtill retained and practiſed ever ſince, from the firſt age of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church unto this preſent. The <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> alſo<note n="(g)" place="margin">Rhem. on Mat. 18.17. &amp; 1. Cor. 5.</note> derive the government which they now ſtand for, from the inſtitution of Chriſt, and practiſe of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. And therefore it is untrue which he ſayth, viz. that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts acknowledge a difference betwixt the government inſtituted at the firſt, and that which is now maintained by them. To prove this generall aſſertion he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a particular teſtimony of <hi>Scultingius.</hi> But that which is ſayd of one, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſcribed unto all in ſuch generall termes as he hath done, ſaying of Romes-Champions, <hi>they doe acknowledge</hi> that which Scultingius ſayth, whereas we ſee that the chief of them avouch the contrary.</p>
                  <p>This teſtimony of <hi>Scultingius,</hi> as it is abſurdly fathered upon the Papiſts in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; ſo it is unjuſtly applyed againſt us. Though in the primitive Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders being impenitent were <hi>excommunicated with conſent and approbation of all, by the Miniſter;</hi> and though this teſtify the power of the Church, for which cauſe it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:112189:105"/>is alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker (from whom it ſeemes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne hath taken this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at ſecond hand, together with his obſervation upon it, touching the force of trueth in a Papiſt) yet this proves not that the Church was not ſubject to the cenſure of a ſuperiour judicatory, if they did abuſe their power. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker drawes no ſuch conſequence from this teſtimony, to exclude the authority of Synods. There is nothing ſayd by Scultingius here, but it hath alwayes bene obſerved in our Church. Offenders are not excommunicated, as being impenitent, before they have bene denounced (as this Authors phraſe is) or complained of by giving notice of their eſtate unto the whole Church; before whom alſo the ſentence of excommunication is pronounced: and this our manner was allowed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Park. being ſometime one of us, as I ſhewed<note n="(h)" place="margin">P. 105.</note> before.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Saravia</hi> and <hi>Schola Pariſienſis,</hi> whom he alledgeth together in the next place, obſerve, 1. How little M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne underſtands what the Authors be whom he alledgeth, not knowing whether they were Papiſts or Proteſtants, placing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> in the number of Papiſts: ſo well is he acquainted with the Authors he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth at ſecond hand; ſuch injury he doth to his witneſſes. So afterward<note n="(i)" place="margin">P. 93, &amp; 98.</note> againe in this ſame book he wrongeth <hi>Saravia</hi> by ſetting him among the Popiſh Writers, and making him of their profeſſion and religion, by accuſing me to make the ſame objection and to uſe the ſame reaſon that Papiſts doe, and then giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Saravia</hi> for one of them. What a blindenes and inconſideratenes is this in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne? 11. He perverts the meaning both of <hi>Saravia</hi> and <hi>Schola Pariſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> for what though they grant that <hi>all Eccleſiaſticall authority belongeth to the Church primarily, &amp;c.</hi> doth it follow hence that the power of Claſſicall and Provinciall Synods is <hi>an und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> power,</hi> as W.B. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. accuſe them? doth it not rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there is a due power, ſecondarily and by delegation, in Synods, where the Deputies of the Churches meet together in their name? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker<note n="(k)" place="margin">Pol. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. l. 3. p. 29.30. &amp; 42.</note> from whom he hath both theſe teſtimonies, doth not ſo alledge them againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Synods. He might have ſeen theſe words in the ſame place cited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker out of Saravia, whereby authority is aſſcribed not onely unto the Church but alſo unto Synods, when he is<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 42.</note> brought in ſaying, <hi>Biſhops &amp; Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have no authority, but what is conferred and beſtowed upon them by the Church and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi> III. He perverts the meaning of <hi>Schola Pariſienſis,</hi> which ſpeakes not of particular Congregations, but of the Univerſall Church, and ſpecially as it is repreſented in a Generall Councell. This is plaine and evident throughout that whole writing. IV. He doth deale deceitfully in his tranſlation of that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Schol. Pariſ.</hi> for the Doctours of Sorbon doe there ſay that all Eccleſiaſticall authority doth belong to the Church primarily, properly, eſſentially, <hi>but unto the Romane Pope and other Biſhops inſtrumentally, miniſterially, and for execution onely, &amp;c.</hi> inſtead of <hi>the Romane Pope and other Biſhops,</hi> he puts in the word <hi>Officers</hi> onely to blinde the eyes of the Readers, who if thoſe words had not bene left out, might eaſily have ſeene that they ſpake of ſuch tranſcendent and uſurped authority as is exerciſed by the Pope and his Biſhops &amp;c. Hence it may appeare what is to be judged of that which he inferres from this teſtimony, to make it ſerve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in oppugning of Synods.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:112189:105"/>
                  <p>As for <hi>Alphonſus de Castro</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Victoria,</hi> 1. It is an errour to approve their teſtimony there<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 78.79.</note> alledged, viz. that <hi>all Biſhops doe receive juriſdiction and power immediately from God:</hi> for then ſhould they all have an extraordinary calling, ſuch as the Apoſtles had, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1, 15, 16. whereas all ordinary Miniſters have their juriſdiction not immediately from God, but mediately by men, and from the Church. How erroneouſly doe W.B. and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. put light for darknes and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for light, when they avouch, that <hi>thus God ordered theſe mens tongues, to give witneſſe unto his trueth?</hi> 11. All the ſhew of help which they pretend to have from this teſtimony is grounded upon that groundleſſe conſequence, whereby they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that Claſſes &amp; Synods have no authority over particular Congregations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Churches, Elderſhips and Officers are equall: This their aſſertion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines yet to be proved; which we doe expreſſely deny, as I have<note n="(n)" place="margin">P. 159.</note> ſhewed in my anſwer unto his firſt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimonies of the three next Popiſh Authors, viz. <hi>Cuſanus de concord. Cathol. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;c. Sanders de viſib. Mon. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>Scultingius, Hierarch. Anarch. l.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 103. are all of them before alledged by<note n="(o)" place="margin">Pol. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. l. 3. c. 1. p. 2. &amp;c. 3. p. 11.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker, from whence it ſeemes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne hath taken them, but without judgement, not applying them aright. for 1. When they affirme that Chriſts promiſe of giving the keyes unto Peter, <hi>muſt be referred unto the whole Church;</hi> as alſo that Peter <hi>in perſon preſented the body of the Church:</hi> though theſe ſpeeches ſhew the power of binding and looſing to be in the Church, yet can it not hence be inferred that a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to be ſubject unto the cenſure of Claſſes and Synods, or to ſtand under the authority of any Eccleſiaſticall judicatory out of itſelf, when that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is complained of for errour or wrong doing. It is a perverting of theſe ſpeeches, and a falſe conſequence which is drawne from hence, that becauſe a Congregation hath power to judge the members thereof, therefore no other have power to judge of it. 11. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne inferreth hence that the power of electing Miniſters is not in Claſſes or Synods, he beates the ayre, &amp; erres from the Queſtion. When did I ever affirme any ſuch matter? or when did the Claſſis ever offer to obtrude a Miniſter upon us? III. Theſe teſtimonies touching the Keyes given unto the Church, ſhew what power is in the Church originally and primarily; but yet they doe not import that the execution and exerciſe of this power is in the whole Church. Preaching and adminiſtration of the Sacraments are a part of that Eccleſiaſticall authority comprehended in the power of the Keyes; and yet the exerciſe thereof is not permitted to the whole Church, by the confeſſion of the Browniſts themſelves.</p>
                  <p>For his next witneſſe, having alledged the words of <hi>Ferus upon Act.</hi> 11. that <hi>the Church may not onely exact an account of her Miniſters, but alſo depoſe them, and reject them altogether if they be not fit, &amp;c.</hi> he inſulteth hereupon and gloryeth, ſaying, <hi>What can be more for us then this?</hi> I anſwer, This might have bene more for you, if he had ſayd, that when a Congregation hath depoſed their Miniſter, there is no other Eccleſiaſticall judicatory that may judge whether they have done well or ill. This had bene to the purpoſe: then had he abſolutely granted you the thing which the Browniſts ſtand for: but this he doth not. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:112189:106"/>from his miniſtery by them of the Separation, and when they rejected him altogether, and left both his miniſtery and the fellowſhip of all that took part with him; was it not his &amp; their miſery that there was none to judge betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>
                  <p>When he alledgeth the names of <hi>Gratian, Gregorie, P. Aeneas Sylvius, Pope Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus, Sixtus Senenſis. Thomas of Aquine, Alexander of Ales, Iohn Scot, &amp;c.</hi> ſome of them affirming that <hi>the greateſt authority is in the Church,</hi> that <hi>the keyes were given to all the Apoſtles;</hi> others <hi>that all Biſhops are equall in power, and the like:</hi> theſe and the like ſpeeches being alledged to prove the undue power of Claſſes and Synods, they are all perverted, neither can the queſtion in controverſy be ever concluded from hence againſt us. It is a moſt falſe conſequence, to inferre that becauſe all Biſhops are equall in power, therefore Synods have no power to judge: and as falſe it is to inferre that becauſe the Keyes were given to all the Apoſtles, therefore there is no Eccleſiaſticall power to judge the actions of a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>In ſumme, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne doth moſt ignorantly and groſly abuſe all theſe Papiſts, againſt their words, their writings, and their continuall profeſſion and practiſe. For though there be this maine difference betwixt the Papiſts, that ſome of them doe aſſcribe the greateſt authority unto the Church, that is, unto a Generall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, or Councell, maintayning that they have infallibility of judgement above the Pope, &amp; power to depoſe the Pope; others of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſcribing more authority and infallibility of judgement unto the Pope, rather then unto the Church or a Generall Councell repreſenting the ſame: yet doe they all agree in this, that there is a ſuperiour power above particular Congregations to judge the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Doctours of <hi>Sorbon</hi> have in ſpeciall manner from time to time maintayned the authority of a Generall Councell above the Pope; they<note n="(p)" place="margin">De Eccl. &amp; Polit.

Could they not therefore ſtand under the authority of Synods? It is a perverted reaſoning ſo to argue. Even here all the Reformed Churches among us have equall power, and are partly Democraticall, and yet are mutually and equally ſubject to one another in their Synods. 3. There is another egregious falſification in the alledging of this teſtimony, by omitting that which principally concernes the Queſtion: for when theſe of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> ſay here, that all Churches had equall power of teaching the Word, adminiſtring of Sacraments, excommunicating, ordination and depoſition of Miniſters, they adde withall in the ſame Chapter, and in the very ſame ſentence &amp; period, in the words immediately following touching this equall power of Churches, that it was for <hi>the gathering of Synods and Aſſemblies,</hi> and this not for counſell onely, but <hi>for the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and deciding of matters doubtfull and controverted.</hi> And not onely this, but after againe in the ſame page,<note n="(m)" place="margin">Col. 135.</note> this power of Synods in judging and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Hereticks, is further declared and repeated, it being the very ſcope of that Section to deſcribe the power of Synods in the conſociation of Churches.

Obſerve how farre it is from the Queſtion: for though the Paſtours looked every one to the health of his owne flock, this prooves not that the power of Claſſes and Synods is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due power. Doth he thinke that either I or any Miniſter of theſe Reformed Churches will not acknowledge the ſame? Yea doe not Paſtours then looke the better to the ſafety of their flockes, when as in needfull caſes they ſeek the help of Synods therein? 2. Let him conſider his<note n="(p)" place="margin">Magdeb.

That M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brightmans words are perverted and wreſted to a wrong end, againſt the authority of Synods, contrary to his meaning, it appeareth by the rare and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant teſtimony he gives unto them in the<note n="(r)" place="margin">On Rev. 8.3, 4.</note> ſame book, where he teacheth that the viſion and type of the Angel ſtanding at the golden Altar before the throne with a golden cenſer full of incenſe, was accompliſhed in <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together ſo many holy men in the Synod or Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the controverſy about <hi>Arius,</hi> and ſhewes that the wholeſome concluſion and happy iſſue of that Synod, effected by the care, labour, diligence and charges of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was acceptable to God in Chriſt, and as a thick cloud of incenſe aſcending out of the hand of the Angel in the preſence of God. And thus alſo he<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">OnRev. 7.2, 3.</note> interprets a former viſion of another Angel that came up from the riſing of the Sunne, having the ſeale of the living God, to ſeale the ſervants of God in their foreheads.

While the Godhead of Chriſt coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and conſubſtantiall with the Father was maintained in that Synod, and the trueth ſpread abroad by the authority of Conſtantine and of that Synod, and many confirmed in the profeſſion thereof, thereby they were ſealed in their foreheads, &amp; the name both of the Lamb and of the Father was imprinted on their foreheads, according to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.1.</p>

                  <p>In the next place<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 81.</note> he brings divers allegations of Scriptures and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to prove that we may not change the Apoſtolick Government, nor leave
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:112189:109"/>their inſtitutions, &amp;c. In all which he beates the ayre, and trifles, leaving the queſtion that is betwixt us, as I have noted<note n="(d)" place="margin">P. 145. &amp;c.</note> before: ſeeing they prove not that the authority of Synods is againſt the Apoſtolick inſtitution. Come we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto his teſtimonies of Lutheranes, &amp; of ſuch as he confuſedly mingles with them, viz. of <hi>Zuinglius, Luther, Chemnitius, Melancthon, Sarcerius, Brentius, D. Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Hunnius, Oſiander, Salneccer, Pelargus, D. Mylius, Hegendorphin, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe all are notably perverted by him. for to anſwer firſt in generall: What though theſe teach that the power of excommunication, of calling Miniſters, &amp;c. is in the whole Church; doth it therefore follow that Synods may not judge the actions of a whole Congregation if they abuſe their power? If Congregations call a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, though never ſo vile or ſo unworthy, or if they would excommunicate an innocent perſon; ſhall there be no liberty of appeale unto a ſuperiour Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call judicatory for the redreſſe of ſuch wrongs? Or doe any of his Lutherane wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes condemne ſuch an appeale? This he ought to have concluded from their Teſtimonies by ſome juſt conſequence, if he would have ſpoken to the purpoſe. The inſultation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. and W. B. upon theſe teſtimonies is moſt vaine, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth many falſhoods. It is falſe that my opinion is <hi>a new opinion</hi> as they call it: It is falſe that theſe Lutheranes are <hi>contrary unto me:</hi> It is falſe that upon my grounds <hi>Officers how vile ſoever muſt be left alone, if Miniſters of other Churches judge them fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue:</hi> It is groſſely falſe that the power which I leave unto particular Churches is <hi>juſt nothing:</hi> It is an open and foule falſhood, that theſe many Authors alledged doe <hi>conſent fully with them,</hi> viz. with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne and W. Beſt. But this will more plainly appeare, if we take a particular ſurvey of the chief of thoſe witneſſes here produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whoſe teſtimonies he vouchſafeth to ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe is <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who though he was no Lutherane, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne notes in his margine, who had promiſed to ſet downe his allegations taken from Lutheranes, next after the Papiſts; yet here he is brought in with <hi>Luther.</hi> And as he is miſplaced in reſpect of the order which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. propounded to himſelf, ſo his teſtimonies both touching excommunication and calling of Miniſters are unjuſtly alledged againſt us. In the firſt ſort of teſtimonies touching excommunication, not to ſpeake of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes altering and tranſpoſing his Authors words to make them ſerve his owne purpoſe, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> reprooves the abuſes and enormities of the Pope and his Biſhops, undertaking by their ſole authority to excommunicate thoſe that were none of their Church. His words are theſe,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Art. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>No private man may excommunicate, but the Church wherein he that is to be excommunicated doth dwell, together with the Biſhop.</hi> And in the explication of that Article, having ſpoken of other abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, he ſaith, <hi>Can the Biſhop alone exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate: Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication doth not belong unto any one man whoſoever he be, but unto the Church.</hi> By theſe &amp; the like ſpeeches of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> it appeares that his teſtimonies are not prejudiciall unto our practiſe, nor unto that authority of Synods which we maintaine: ſeeing we grant that no one perſon alone can by right excommunicate any man by his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; neither can any Church or Churches excommunicate thoſe that are not in communion with them. The other place cited out of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> touching the calling of Miniſters, is ſo farre from prooving any thing againſt us, that being
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:112189:110"/>duely conſidered it may fitly ſerve to blame thoſe popular courſes which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can. pleades for, and to juſtify our practiſe in not performing this weighty buſineſſe without the adviſe and approbation of neighbour Miniſters aſſembled in the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in that treatiſe called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> having ſpoken of the Popiſh tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, bereaving moſt Churches of the liberty of election, he reprooves another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, ſaving,<note n="(f)" place="margin">Eccleſ. Tom. 2. f. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>If there were any Church unto which election was yet left free, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people raſhly, without all deliberation, and without all counſell of learned, prudent and faithfull men, did chooſe thoſe whom they did moſt favour, &amp; not ſuch as were indued with true vertues beſeeming a Biſhop. Therefore there is nothing ſo agreeable unto the Divine ordinance and ancient inſtitution, as that the whole Congregation of a faithfull people, together with ſome learned and godly Biſhops, or other faithfull and experienced men, doe make choyſe of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour.</hi> Thus he plainly diſavowes the independency of Churches in ſuch caſes, not allowing a Congregation to proceed unto the election of a Miniſter, without the aſſiſtance of the Miniſters of other Churches, and to this effect he explaines himſelf further in the ſame place, ſaying, <hi>It is meet that the power of election ſhould be in the Church being furniſhed with the counſels of faithfull and learned men. For as that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may not lye in the power of any one man, ſo neither may the rude and unlearned multitude take upon them ſo great a weight of election, &amp;c.</hi> And in the ſame leafe ſpeaking of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts intruding themſelves into the Churches of their owne accord, he proves that they are no lawfull Miniſters becauſe they have not a due calling, thus, <hi>Biſhops they are not. for they are not choſen of any Church by lawfull and unanimous conſent, the authority of other Biſhops excelling in faith and prudence, alſo concurring.</hi> Obſerve how that with the free conſent of the people he joynes not onely the counſell or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, as he had called it before, but the <hi>authority</hi> of the Officers of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
                  <p>Moreover that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did not abſolutely deny the authority of Synods, though he ſpeake much againſt Popiſh Synods, may appeare if we conſider the reaſons which he uſeth againſt them, viz. becauſe they were not aſſembled in the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they did not judge of matters according to the Scriptures, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinances and cuſtomes of men, &amp;c.

                     <hi>that Christ hath delivered and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Keyes, that is, the miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments, unto the whole Church; but not ſo, that everie one raſhly and of his owne accord ſhould take unto himſelf and exerciſe that miniſtery without a lawfull calling: but that after immediate calling hath ceaſed, God ſends the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, by the calling and election of the Church, if it be performed according to the direction of his word; ſo that the chiefe power of the Word and Sacraments is in God; ſecondly that the ministery is in the Church, as by which God doth mediately call, chooſe, and ſend Ministers; thirdly in thoſe who are lawfully choſen and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God by the Church, as in the Ministers, to whom is commanded the exerciſe or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the ministery of the Word and Sacraments.</hi> Not to ſpeake of ſome difference, which the Reader may eaſily perceive, betwixt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes allegation and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words; there is nothing here ſayd that doth any way prejudice the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Synods, neither can he from hence inferre any thing againſt us.

                     <q>There <hi>Melanthon</hi> intending to ſpeak of Synods, reaſoneth thus: It is moſt true and moſt agreeable unto the nature of men that which Plato ſayth, that the beſt ſtate of a Common-wealth is that which is the meane betwixt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and Democratie, [or popular government.] This is to be framed and maintained, as in all government ſo eſpecially in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both theſe, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and Democratie, are to be avoyded and deteſted in the Church, as moſt noyſome plagues. It is Tyrannie to conſtraine men to approve of manifeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, to obey contrary to the cleare word of God, &amp;c. Againe Democratie alſo muſt be removed from the Church, that is, the common people without difference are not to have licence or power granted unto them to alter doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, or to give ſentence concerning doctrines, for the Multitude alſo, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus ſayth, is a moſt cruell Tyrant. But a middle ſtate is to be ſought, that is, Ariſtocratie ought to be eſtabliſhed, wherein by proportion the authority of the learnedeſt and beſt men may be the greateſt. This Ariſtocratie Paul requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and it is moſt gravely written unto the Romanes, that every one muſt know the meaſure of his owne faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Therefore that tyrannicall ſpeech is to be hiſſed at, which takes away this proportion in the Church, and aſſcribes unto the Pope an unbounded Tyrannie, viz. which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that greater is the authority of the Pope then of the whole Councell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, &amp;c. In the choyſe of judges the beſt way is to follow that meane betwixt Tyrannie and Democratie, namely to chooſe the beſt and the learnedeſt. When by the conſent of both parties good and learned judges are choſen, and matters have bene examined in order, it is meet there ſhould be an obeying of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for every one ought to know the meaſure of his owne faith.</q> Thus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthon hath fully declared himſelf in this controverſy touching the ground of Synodall government, together with the power and uſe of the ſame: yet for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction it may be obſerved how that in another place he applyes that which is here ſpoken againſt Democratie or popular order, unto that part thereof which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne ſo much pleades for, concerning election unto Church-offices, when he ſayth,<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ibid. f. 442.</note>

                     <hi>And now</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Paget <hi>what thinke you of theſe men? were they not</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly Miniſters, Reverend and judicious Divines? <hi>Are they not</hi> authentick witneſſes? <hi>If you confeſſe it; then marke what followes: viz. your poſition that</hi> particular Congregations muſt ſtand under other Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>is hence condemned, by a jurie of more then</hi> 24 <hi>men, of your owne chooſing, for an errour and untruth: The reaſon is; becauſe theſe affirme (I ſay all of them) that every particular Elderſhip, with the Churches conſent, may lawfully proceed among themſelves to the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of offenders, whenſoever there is neceſſary and juſt cauſe. Neither doe they ſay a word; that it is a</hi> Divine inſtitution, <hi>that the Miniſters of one Congregation, muſt firſt aſke the leave and conſent of other Miniſters, before they can lawfully adminiſter this ordinance of God.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer; The more Reverend, Godly and learned theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were, the greater is his offence that ſhewes ſo little reverence unto them, in perverting and abuſing their teſtimonies. If any Advocate ſhould ſo farre wrong a <hi>Iurie</hi> of 24 men, as to falſify their verdict contrary to their meaning; might it not juſtly be counted a great forgery, and worthy of exemplary puniſhment? Now that this is the fault of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. the Advocate and abettour of W. B. it may appeare in the firſt place, by the generall conſideration of their teſtimonies alledged. For though it be generally affirmed by theſe Authors, that matters of great weight, as excommunication, abſolution, chooſing of Miniſters and the like, are not to be adminiſtred without the common conſent of the Church; yet this proves not that it is unlawfull to ſeek the counſell and help of a Claſſis or Synod beforehand for the preventing of wrong, or that it is unlawfull to appeale unto them in caſe of wrong done. Though particular Congregations have power to judge, it followes not, that they themſelves are therefore ſubject to no other Eccleſiaſticall judgment out of themſelves. The errour &amp; abſurdity of this conſequence may better appeare by theſe examples: Though fathers &amp; maſters of particular families have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate authority from God, &amp; power to uſe it in a domeſticall way, to performe familie dueties, &amp; judge of matters in the family; yet this hinders not but that their familie exerciſes &amp; works may be judged of by other authority in the city, where many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bined together for their mutuall governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Though particular cities
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:112189:114"/>in and for themſelves have power to execute judgement, and to puniſh offences committed among them; yet this hinders not but that if they judge unjuſtly or abuſe their authority, that they themſelves may then be judged of others.</p>

Though Muſculus differ from other Reformed Churches in this queſtion of Church-government; yet he alſo moſt evidently (even more then I doe) condemnes the opinion of the Browniſts and of my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, while he<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ibid. de elect.

If <hi>Muſculus</hi> had bene of <hi>Mr Cannes &amp; W.

Another is this, that men come not to it by any corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gifts; but that it be free: ſo as they that have the power to choſe, ſhould have onely the glory of God, and the edification of his Church before their eyes.

This makes greatly for the maintaining of Church-diſcipline, for the reſtraining of the ambition of Church-governours, for the preſerving of conſent in true doctrine, and for the repreſſing of hereſies, which (if Miniſters doe not moſt faithfully joyne their paines together) are wont of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to creep in.</hi> This he declares againe by the example of that Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and he commends the pietie and prudence of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> for his frequent aſſembling of Synods; as on the other ſide he notes the wickednes of <hi>Licinius</hi> and of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in reſiſting and hindring the due exerciſe of this <hi>authority of Synods.</hi> How doe theſe things agree with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes diſcourſe, who yet alledgeth this Author, as one of the Jurie, by which he ſaith my poſition (as he calles it) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, viz. that particular Congregations muſt ſtand under other Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of themſelves?</p>

And in this very book alledged, he in his firſt entrance, in the preface to the Senate of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of <hi>Grotius</hi> for oppugning this order of Claſſes and Synods; and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his preface he profeſſeth that there was ſcarſely any other meanes then a Nationall Synod to heale the evills of that time, and deſires them to perſwade the calling thereof.

In his Diſputation with <hi>Bertius</hi> he ſhewes<note n="(c)" place="margin">Epiſt.

His appeale unto the judgement of other Churches, and his willingnes to ſubmit unto their judgement, with his deſire of a Nationall Synod, is plainely declared therein.

                     <hi>Bucer,</hi> laſt alledged, accordes with the foregoing Authors, and his words in commendation of Synods may ſerve to cloſe up this kinde of Teſtimonies, being an adviſe unto King Edward the Sixt, for the conſtant celebrating of them. In his Admonition given to the King for the reſtitution of the Kingdome of Chriſt in his dominions, amidſt other wholeſome counſels out of the word of God, he ſaith,<note n="(y)" place="margin">De Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Chriſti. Lib. 2. c. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſhall be the duety of the Biſhops of each Province to celebrate two Synods every yeare, as it is ordained by ſo many Canons, and Lawes of godly Emperours. At which Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods muſt be aſſembled and heard, not onely the Biſhops of the Cities, but alſo inferiour Biſhops and other Preſbyters and Deacons, that are endued with a larger meaſure of knowledge and zeale for the kingdome of Chriſt: that ſo the more effectually both the faults crept into the Church may becorrected, and the pietie of all repaired.</hi> He had alſo ſpoken before of other inferiour and more frequent aſſemblies, like unto our Claſſes, requiring that all the Miniſters within the compaſſe of about 20 Pariſhes, ſhould often meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for their mutuall aſſiſtance in removing offences &amp; advancing the kingdome of Chriſt. Touching Synods, he ſpeakes alſo in<note n="(z)" place="margin">De vi &amp; uſu S. Min. tit. de Diſci. Cler. Opuſe. f. 582.</note> another place to the ſame purpoſe, approving the ancient conſtitution, whereby it was ordained that <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of every Province ſhould aſſemble together with the Preſbyters and Deacons, as often as the need of the Churches ſhould require, but without faile twiſe in the yeare; that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning the doctrine and diſcipline of Chriſt, how it were administred and did flouriſh in ſeverall Churches; that where any default was diſcovered they might correct it; and where they found things in good state, they might confirme and promote the ſame.</hi> By that <hi>correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſpoken of here and in the former teſtimonie, he underſtands not onely counſell
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:112189:119"/>and admonition, but the judiciall exerciſe of authority in Eccleſiaſticall cenſures: For he doth plainly diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>admonition</hi> and <hi>correction,</hi> when in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words concerning Metropolitanes he ſaith, <hi>If any thing were done amiſſe by the Miniſters of the Churches, or by the common people, which by their admonitions they could not amend, that then for the correcting of it they ſhould call a Synod of Biſhops: for there was no [power] of judgement allowed unto them, which by their owne authority they might exerciſe in the Churches, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Bucerus</hi> alſo, as well as the former, hath condemned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes poſition, viz. that particular Congregations muſt not ſtand under other Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are all the Authors here alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, except onely <hi>Morell, Praedirius</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> either not ſeen at all, nor to be procured for the preſent, as the two former; or not ſeen to touch this controverſie in the writings at hand, as the latter.</p>
                  <p>Having now heard what theſe choſen men of the <hi>Iurie,</hi> all nominated by W. B. his Advocate, have teſtifyed concerning Claſſes or Synods; let the Reader judge whether they have given verdict for or againſt Synods: whether every one of theſe Authors alledged had not juſt cauſe (if they were living) to complaine of great abuſe done to them in perverting their teſtimonies, and making falſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from their words contrary to their meaning. And foraſmuch as all theſe witneſſes here examined are ſo farre from teſtifying ought againſt us, that they have on the other ſide witneſſed the trueth of that which we maintained againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne; hence it is evident that I had juſt cauſe to ſay that which he would ſeeme to diſprove by alledging theſe Authors againſt me, viz. that there were <hi>a multitude of learned and godly Miniſters of the ſame judgement and practiſe with me.</hi> For further proofe whereof it were eaſy (if need were) to produce another <hi>Iurie</hi> of approved Authors, more in number then thoſe he hath ſpecifyed, and not inferiour for learning and piety unto ſome of thoſe that he hath named, all which in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall writings, Common places, Commentaries and other Treatiſes, have in like manner as the former, deſcribed the uſe, the neceſſity and the authority of Synods, not onely for counſell, but for judgement and deciſion of controverſies; divers of them alledging not onely examples of ancient Churches, but the holy Scriptures alſo for the warrant of that which they teach, and therefore ſhewing that they maintaine them lawfull <hi>jure divino;</hi> and that their tenure of them is from the grant that Chriſt hath given unto his Church. But the trueth of that aſſertion touching the <hi>multitude</hi> of thoſe that conſent with me, will moſt plainly appeare when we come to ſpeak of the publick and generall teſtimonies of whole Churches &amp; moſt ſolemne aſſemblies of learned &amp; godly men, touching this controverſie. In the meane while let us follow M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, according to his owne Method.</p>

                  <p>Touching theſe I anſwer: Firſt for B. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> though he confeſſe that <hi>in the Apoſtles time the ſtate of the Church was popular,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Def. ag. T. C. p. 180. 182.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe the Church had intereſt almoſt in every thing;</hi> yet this proves not that he thought particular Congregations to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and uncontrolable by the Deputies of other Churches aſſembled in Synods. The ordinary practiſe of B. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> in judging the cauſes of other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, ſhewed that he was farre from the meaning of the Browniſts in this poynt. His words are wreſted by an unjuſt conſequence to prove independency of Churches, and the undue power of Synods.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>D. Bilſon,</hi> there is notable wrong done to him, in clipping his words, and defacing his teſtimonie, by omitting that which is moſt materiall in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy.

                     <hi>Though the Preſbyters had more ſkill to judge, yet the people had as much right to chooſe their Pastour; &amp; if the most part of them did agree, they did carrie it from the Clergie;</hi> Thus farre M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne reciteth his words, but here in the midſt of the ſentence, before the period be ended, he breakes off and leaves out this exception that is added, viz. <hi>ſo the perſons choſen were ſuch as the Canons did allow, and the ordainers could not juſtly miſlike.</hi> In this exception D. B. acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that there may be juſt cauſe to diſanull the election of the people, if it be found worthy to be miſliked. And his meaning is yet more evident by the ſtory which in the ſentence immediately preceding he alledgeth out of<note n="(b)" place="margin">Lib. 7. cap. 35.</note>

That which is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in theſe Reformed Churches, is in this poynt the very ſame thing that D. B. teſtifies of the Primitive Church: for Claſſes and Synods doe not uſe to impoſe or chooſe Miniſters. If particular Congregations doe chooſe a Miniſter, neither Claſſes nor Synods can diſanull the election, if there be no juſt cauſe of exception againſt the perſon elected. And if upon juſt exception the election be hindred yet then alſo is the new election of another permitted to the free choyſe of the particular Church; neither doth the Claſſis deprive them of their juſt power and liberty therein.</p>
                  <p>That it may more plainly appeare how unjuſtly and unreaſonably <hi>D.

                  <p>For anſwer hereunto; Firſt, concerning ſome of theſe that ſeeme to be of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes minde, in denying the authority of Synods in the government of the Church, obſerve how idlie and ſuperfluouſly he alledgeth them againſt me; when as he knowes that I my ſelf did acknowledge and note ſo much before, as namely the judgement of<note n="(f)" place="margin">Anſw. to W.

                     <hi>Mr Hooker,</hi>
                     <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 27</note> 
                     <hi>D. Ames,</hi> and the Author of the booke enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Engliſh Puritaniſme,</hi> by whom alſo the <hi>Protestation of K. Supremacie</hi> is ſayd to be written. Theſe I have confeſſed to be oppoſite unto me in this controverſy, &amp; have long ſince profeſſed unto them how much I have diſliked their opinions in this poynt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though theſe witneſſes have teſtifyed their particular judgement, yet did they never deny but that they differed herein from many other godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in England, which deſired a reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church as well as they. When as I expoſtulated with <hi>D. Ames</hi> long ſince, touching the publiſhing of that treatiſe of <hi>Engliſh Puritaniſme,</hi> and complayned of wrong done unto many ſilenced Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who did not hold ſuch opinions as are contained in that booke; his excuſe was that they did not aſſirme thoſe to be the opinions of all, but onely of the <hi>Rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest ſort of thoſe that are called Puritanes,</hi> and that ſo much was ſpecifyed in the Title of that book. And againe in the preface of that book, thoſe opinions are ſayd to be <hi>the worst that the worst of them hold:</hi> and the perſons that doe hold thoſe peculiar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are there againe diſtinguiſhed from others by the title and name of <hi>Rigid Preſbyterians.</hi> Now though theſe expreſſions be not without ſome offence, yet from hence it may appeare that the Authors and Publiſhers thereof were farre from that ſlanderous diſpoſition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, in charging thoſe of different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to have changed and altered their judgement; when as he ſaith,<note n="(h)" place="margin">Chu. pl. p. 86.</note> 
                     <hi>Time was when</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Paget <hi>did eſteeme them to be a multitude of godly and learned Miniſters; and was (or at leaſt made ſhew he was) of their judgement and practiſe.</hi> An unconſcionable inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation againſt me. And afterwards againe he ſaith,<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ib. p. 88.</note> 
                     <hi>Mr Paget hath left the way of Non-conformitie, yea and ſhewes himſelf to it a great adverſary, &amp;c.</hi> A groſſe ſlander. Whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne ſaith further touching the <hi>Proteſtation of K. Supremacic,</hi> that this booke was<note n="(k)" place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>ſet out under the name of all the unconformable Miniſters in the Realme;</hi> this is a notable falſhood: for neither is the word <hi>All</hi> uſed in the title of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:112189:121"/>made in the name of afflicted Miniſters indefinitely; neither can it ever be proved that all thoſe Miniſters did ever conſent unto that opinion there ſpecifyed, and alledged by him, viz. <hi>We confine and binde all Eccleſiaſticall power within the limits onely of one particular Congregation, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as for <hi>Mr Bradſhaw</hi> that wrote the forenamed <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> &amp; that book of <hi>Engliſh Puritaniſme,</hi> if he were ſuch an one as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne reports him to be now after his death, then were his teſtimony and his writing the leſſe to be regarded. For he ſaith of him, that<note n="(l)" place="margin">Neceſſ. of Separ. p. 217.</note> 
                     <hi>his proofes are alwayes</hi> beggerly I ſayes, <hi>or</hi> Ifs, <hi>and</hi> may be ſoes; <hi>and doth not in all his writing, either directly or by ſound conſequence from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, confirme any one thing whereof he ſpeaketh.</hi> He accuſeth him there alſo of <hi>great hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy</hi> in pleading for many evills, of which his judgement was well knowne to be <hi>wholy otherwiſe.</hi> And in the ſame place upon an <hi>if</hi> and a <hi>may be ſo,</hi> which he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately condemned in others, upon a report which he judgeth <hi>probable enough,</hi> he compares him to <hi>Baalams Aſſe, &amp;c.</hi> What meant M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne to alledge ſuch witneſſes againſt me, whom he himſelfe (though indeed very unworthily) hath ſo deſcribed as if they were not worthy to have any credit given unto them?</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>D. Ames,</hi> &amp; his judgement in this controverſy, ſomewhat differently expreſſed in his ſeverall writings, I have ſpoken at large<note n="(m)" place="margin">P. 106-111.</note> before, in anſwer to <hi>Mr Dav.</hi> his Allegations.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Mr Hooker,</hi> his argument<note n="(n)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 88.</note> annexed to his Teſtimony, is of no force againſt us, ſeeing he concludes beſide the queſtion, which was not of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, but of ſuch as ſtood already in combination with a Claſſis.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne ſaith,<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ib. P. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>This may not be forgotten. Whereas there are many hundreds of our Country-men in</hi> New-England, <hi>they have not erected there any</hi> Claſſicall Government, <hi>but every particular Church exerciſeth her owne, I ſay, within herſelf wholy; which is a ſure argument to proove, that the foreward profeſsours in England approove not of this kinde of government here pleaded for; although he would feigne have his Reader to thinke ſo.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer: 1. What the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> is, and whether they refuſe the help of Claſſes and Synods for the judgement and determination of their controverſies, according to the order of Reformed Churches here in Europe; I know not: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I receive the teſtimony of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne &amp; his bare word for a ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence herein, without ſome more authentick witneſſe. Divers bookes have bene publiſhed touching the nature of that ſoyle, the fruits of the countrie, &amp; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the wilde people: but touching the Eccleſiaſticall government and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline there practiſed, I have as yet ſeene no monument thereof. It is probable enough that thoſe Separatiſts which had bene of <hi>Mr Robinſons</hi> company here at <hi>Leyden,</hi> in their plantation would obſerve their old order, as neere as they could: and for ſome particular perſons beſide, I have heard of their inclination that way; but that there ſhould be a generall agreement &amp; reſolution againſt Claſſicall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, I heare not; and ought therefore to ſuſpend my judgement for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, touching their practiſe. 11. Suppoſe every particular Congregation in New-England were independent, and ſubject to no other Eccleſiaſticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of itſelfe; yet is this no ſure argument to prove that the forward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:112189:122"/>in England (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne calles them) are generally of the ſame opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; ſeeing theſe in England may be ignorant of that which is done ſo farre of. Yea, ſo farre as I can heare, even ſuch as have bene diligent to enquire, cannot yet get any certaine information, what order of government is reſolved upon in New-England.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Mr Bates,</hi> I can ſay nothing touching his aſſent or diſſent in this poynt, ſeeing I have not ſeene his writing alledged againſt us.</p>
                  <p>For the reſt, they are all notably abuſed. For the Authour of the <hi>Reply unto D. Downame,</hi> though he affirme that <hi>the adminiſtration of all Church-matters, at firſt was in every Congregation, the right in the Church, the execution in the Preſbyterie thereof;</hi> this doth neither exclude the Claſſis in cenſuring of the Preſbyterie if they abuſe their power, nor hinder the Preſbyterie from ſeeking the help of the Claſſis in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their power, in matters of doubt and difficultie. The teſtimonies out of the <hi>Centuries, D. Whitgift, Thomas Bell,</hi> there<note n="(p)" place="margin">Repl. par 2. l. 2. p. 104</note> alledged by the <hi>Replyer,</hi> are anſwered already in the ſeverall places which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne hath aſſigned unto them in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; where it hath bene ſhewed that in this controverſie they are impertinent, &amp; doe not proove any thing againſt us. Beſides M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne had the leſſe cauſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this place in the foreſaid <hi>Reply,</hi> ſeeing the Authour in the very next page doth approve of that order, which for election of Church-officers is practiſed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſaying<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 105.</note> that it is <hi>religiouſly and prudently obſerved.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne might there have ſeen himſelf condemned under the name of <hi>Morellius,</hi> even by this <hi>Replyer</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as well as by <hi>Beza;</hi> ſeeing it is as true of him, as of the other, that which is there ſayd, <hi>that he hath preſumed by word and writing to reprehend that order, &amp;c.</hi> our courſe being in ſubſtance the ſame, and oppoſed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. in like manner as theirs was by <hi>Morellius.</hi> Againe, in the<note n="(r)" place="margin">P. 106.</note> next page the ſayd Authour doth expreſſely reject and deteſt that popular government, practiſed among the Browniſts, and pleaded for by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, when having ſayd that the peoples conſent is <hi>not to be neglected in cauſes of greateſt moment,</hi> according to that which we teach and practiſe, he addes withall, <hi>Notwithstanding a meere</hi> Democracie, <hi>wherein all matters are handled of all (ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quato jure) by an equall right; we doe no leſſe deteſt, then that uſurped Monarchie of Lordly Prelates, which other reformed Churches have aboliſhed.</hi> And afterwards<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">P. 113.</note> when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a preheminence for orders ſake, unto ſome one to be the mouth of the reſt, in <hi>executing that which was by the whole Preſbytery decreed,</hi> and then explaines that one to be <hi>the Preſident of the Preſbyters, that is to ſay, in each Congregation the Pastor, and in a Synod or aſſembly of the Pastors and Preſbyters of many Churches, that one which with the conſent and choyſe of his brethren moderates the action;</hi> there is no reaſon why we ſhould not hence conclude his approbation of Synods, ſuch as are and have bene cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in well ordered Churches; even ſuch as doe not onely adviſe, but alſo <hi>decree</hi> what is meet, as he had ſayd of the <hi>Preſbyterie</hi> in generall. As for the other places alledged out of this Authour, I referre the Reader unto that which I have ſayd<note n="(r)" place="margin">P. 116.117.</note> before touching the ſame, in my anſwer to <hi>Mr Davenport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr Parker,</hi> next alledged, <hi>ſpeakes downe right in this thing,</hi> ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne. The words cited out of <hi>Mr Parker,</hi> are theſe, <hi>All Eccleſiaſticall power is alwayes in the whole Congregation, from hence it flowes, as from the fountaine, and to the ſame it returneth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:112189:122"/>as to the Sea.</hi> For anſwer hereunto, 1. This Teſtimony here alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. is not onely cited amiſſe, viz. <hi>Pol. Eccl. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. inſtead of <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 28. and ſome words alſo unjuſtly added by him unto the teſtimony, to make it ſeeme more full for his purpoſe; but being taken as he ſets it downe, it doth not infringe the authority of Claſſes and Synods. For though all Eccleſiaſticall authority be ſayd to flow from the Church, as from a fountaine; this hinders not, but rather ſhewes how power may be and is derived unto Claſſes, when particular Churches as fountaines doe by deputation and delegation ſend forth a ſtreame of authority and power in Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall and Synodall Aſſemblies, in ſuch manner as <hi>Mr Parker</hi> himſelf doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note n="(v)" place="margin">Pol. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. l. 3 c. 13. &amp;c. 23, 24, 25, &amp;c.</note> often ſhew unto his Reader. II. For the <hi>downe-right</hi> ſpeech of <hi>Mr Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> wherein M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne glorieth, I deſire the Readers that underſtand, to review thoſe paſſages which I have<note n="(x)" place="margin">P. 89-105.</note> before noted at large out of <hi>Mr Parkers</hi> booke, &amp; them that are able, to looke upon thoſe places in the booke itſelf, and then to judge whether M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne be not either very blinde in alledging the teſtimonies of learned men, when he knowes not what they ſay; or els very impudent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, in corrupting and perverting their teſtimonies contrary to their meaning.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Mr Baines,</hi> he is confuſedly alledged, viz. <hi>Dioceſ. Tryall, Concluſ.</hi> 4. for whereas in that booke there is often mention of <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. who can tell what place he meanes? The trueth is that none of thoſe fourth Concluſions in any part of his booke, doe by any word empeach the authority of Claſſes or Synods. But on the contrary, in that his writing he gives plaine and evident teſtimonies of his agreement with us, as I have<note n="(y)" place="margin">P. 111-116.</note> already ſufficiently declared.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the teſtimony<note n="(z)" place="margin">Chu. pl. p. 23.</note> alledged in the name of <hi>D. Fulke,</hi> whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne praiſeth to be <hi>a man famous and of rare learning.</hi> They object unto me that he ſaith<note n="(a)" place="margin">Learned Diſcourſ. of Eccl. Gov. p. 84.</note> 
                     <hi>There ought to be in every Church an Elderſhip, which ought to have the hearing, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and determining of all matters, pertayning to the Diſcipline &amp; Government of that Congregation.</hi> Hereunto I anſwer, that ſuch authority is to be exerciſed by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip, yet ſo as that the judgement and conſent of the Congregation in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters be not excluded: and ſo alſo that the judgement of the Claſſis or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod be not refuſed or denyed. This Author will have the Elderſhip to determine all matters, if they be able to doe it; &amp; ſo he expounds himſelf, ſhewing afterward that there be divers matters which the Elderſhip is not able by themſelves to finiſh without help of a Synod.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne in the margine of his booke ſets his marke over againſt this place, deſiring us to <hi>Note this:</hi> ſo I deſire both him and others to note wel what this Author writes concerning the authoriy, neceſſity, and uſe of Synods. I am glad to heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. to give ſo great commendation unto this indeed Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is ſo pregnant a witneſſe for me and for Synods againſt the Browniſts. This is that which he<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 82.83.</note> ſaith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Seeing our Saviour Chriſt promiſed his preſence and authoritie to every Church indifferently, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.19.20: None may challenge any ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive afore other: but as the Churches are limited out for order and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſo is every one of them of like authority in itſelf: but becauſe they make all but one Church, and one body of Chriſt, therefore there is but one autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:112189:123"/>in them, to determine of matters concerning them all. By which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be a double authority of the Paſtor: one with the ſeverall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he is Paſtour, the other with the whole Synod or aſſembly, whereof he is a member, and both theſe authorities, we finde ſufficiently autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed in the Scripture, &amp;c.</q>

Alſo there be divers caſes, wherein the ſeverall Churches, are driven to pray the ayde of the Synod, where matters cannot be determined among themſelves. For this cauſe the Holy Ghoſt hath ordained theſe Holy aſſemblies, with promiſe that they being gathered together in the name of Chriſt, he himſelf will be among them.

Secondly, it hath to determine of the uſe of the ceremonies, not of will without reaſon or ground of Scripture, but upon neceſſary cauſes of avoiding offence and ſimilitude of ſuperſtition, of bearing with the weak, of order and comelineſſe and edification.

                     <hi>the authority of the Pastour and Seniors is all wiped away; for every thing is referred to the confuſed multitude of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: Mr Whithead</hi> in the ſame booke anſwereth him on this manner, <hi>Where he ſaith, all things is referred to the confuſed multitude, it is manifeſtly falſe.

                  <p>Whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Chu. pl. p. 36.</note> objecteth further from <hi>Art.</hi> 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 67. that in ſome caſes the forenamed Engliſh Church agreed that <hi>appeales ſhould be made unto the body of the Congregation;</hi> I anſwer, that in ſuch caſes as are there ſpecifyed, <hi>If the Miniſters and Seniours which have authority to heare &amp; determine, &amp;c.</hi> (as it is elſwhere ſpecifyed, though not in this Article) <hi>be ſuſpected or found to be parties,</hi> that then they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to appeale rather to the body of the Congregation, then that parties ſhould be ſuffered to be judges in their owne cauſe. And no marvell, conſidering what I have noted<note n="(t)" place="margin">P. 121-125.</note> before touching the ſtate of that Church; where the Reader may ſee a further anſwer unto theſe objections. But then he aſkes me what I ſay to this, and hopes I will not ſay that they were Browniſts: I anſwer, His hope is right in this poynt, I may not ſay they were Browniſts, nor their practiſe the ſame with the Browniſts: 1. Becauſe they made this agreement through neceſſity, when they wanted a Claſſis, whereas the Browniſts wilfully oppugne and refuſe Claſſicall combinations. 2. Becauſe the Browniſts deny authority of judgement
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:112189:125"/>unto Miniſters and Elders, in ſuch caſes where they are no parties, which this<note n="(v)" place="margin">Art. 59.63.</note> Church at Frankford did not. 3.

                  <p>But it is wonder that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne is not aſhamed to alledge the example of this Engliſh Church at Frankford: for whereas <hi>G.

                     <hi>That if any diſſention grow or cauſe of grievance be given in any particular Church by the Miniſter or Officers, the partie grieved might appeale to a particular Synod; from the particular Synod to a Provinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; from a Provinciall Synod to a Nationall Synod.

                  <p>For anſwer hereunto, Firſt in generall it is to be obſerved, that the thing which he here pretends to prove, viz. that <hi>everie particular viſible Church of Christ, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall government, and all other Gods ſpirituall ordinances, in and for itſelf immediately from Christ;</hi> this comes ſhort of the queſtion betwixt us. For this being granted, it doth not follow hereupon that the power of Claſſes and Synods is an <hi>undue power,</hi> or that particular Churches may not therefore ſtand under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of another ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall judicatory out of themſelves.

                     <hi>They came together into the Congregation</hi> [it is not ſayd into <hi>one</hi> Congregation, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it] <hi>for to pray unto God, for to rehearſe the Divine Scriptures, and with holy words yo nouriſh faith, ſtirre up hope, and faſten confidence. And they uſed exhortations, reproofes and divine Cenſure.</hi> I anſwer: I. Though particular Churches met together for ſuch end, this hinders not but that the Deputies of thoſe ſame Churches might meet together in Synods, for their mutuall aſſiſtance in the judgement of more weighty and difficult cauſes. It followes not becauſe ſeverall Congregations have their due power, that therefore the power of Claſſes is an undue power. II. that <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf intended no ſuch thing, it appeares evidently by the great approbation and commendation which he gives unto Synods, in ſaying,<note n="(i)" place="margin">De Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nüs adverſ.

                     <hi>Obſerve here, he ſaith not that the matter was caried to a Claſſis, and there firſt determined, &amp;c. but

I. The words which they alledge in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letter in <hi>Origens</hi> name, as if they had bene his ſpeech verbatim deſcribed, are not his words. He neither ſpeakes of men <hi>brought unto the Church,</hi> nor of the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Church, nor of <hi>Elders pronouncing the ſentence:</hi> he ſhewes how all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be polluted by the ſinne of one man, when <hi>the Briefts which rule the people being unmindefull of prieſtly ſeverity</hi> doe not rebuke, nor take away evill from them, nor make him as a Publicane and Heathen which hath deſpiſed the admonition of the Church; but not in ſuch words and forme of ſpeech as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne faineth. II. All that <hi>Origen</hi> there ſpeakes is not repugnant to Claſſicall government: all that he there requireth is dayly performed by the Churches among us, which ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of Claſſes and Synods. Obſtinate offenders having their names and offences divers times publiſhed before the whole Congregation, are with the conſent thereof excommunicated, by the judgement of the Elderſhip going before. III. If <hi>Origen</hi> in his writings had expreſſely denyed the authority of Synods, it had bene of no great weight againſt the generall judgement of other ancient Fathers; the rather, ſeeing his writings are rejected and condemned by ſo many, eſpecially by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Hieronie,</hi> the Authours hereafter alledged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne.

                     <hi>Why doe I ſpend time? There is nothing more evident to him that is acquainted with the ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of hiſtory, then that neighbours (even beſides the Synod) did eftſoone meet together for deciding of ſtrifes, for ordinations, for diſſolving of doubts, and in ſumme, for every meigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſſe.

                  <p>It is ſayd in the<note n="a" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 90.</note> next place, Euſebius <hi>teſtifyeth that the Churches of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cities were in their conſtitution firſt, but one ordinary conſtant Congregation, as</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem<note n="b" place="margin">Euſ. l. 3.11.</note>, Epheſus<note n="c" place="margin">L. 3.28.</note>, Alexandria<note n="d" place="margin">3.13.</note>, Hierapolis<note n="e" place="margin">4.1.</note>, Corinth<note n="f" place="margin">3.32.</note>, Sardis<note n="g" place="margin">4.22.</note>, &amp;c. <hi>This being ſo, then it followes, that primitively they were independent; and ſtood not under any other Eccleſtaſticall authority, out of themſelves.</hi> In the allegation of theſe teſtimonies out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> there be divers miſtakings and faylings of memory or attention; <hi>Hierapolis</hi> with reference to L. 4.1. where it is not mentioned, but in L. 3.32. <hi>Corinth</hi> with reference to L. 3.32. where it is not found, but after in L.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:112189:129"/>4.22. <hi>Sardis</hi> alledged with reference to L. 4.22. where there is no mention at all thereof, but there is ſuch a mention of <hi>Athens</hi> as is intended for <hi>Sardis.</hi> Theſe ſlips of memory are to be noted for help of the Reader that would examine the places, but may well be excuſed in ſuch a number of quotations. To leave them and to come unto the great abuſes here to be obſerved; I. In all the places here alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth not teſtify that the Churches of theſe Cities, <hi>were in their consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution firſt, but one ordinary conſtant Congregation;</hi> he hath no ſuch words. He gives unto them the name and title of <hi>a Pariſh;</hi> but it is not proved that in every Pariſh there was but one ordinary conſtant Congregation. Whether they were ſo or not, this title of Pariſh proves is not. II. The conſequence made from hence is more evidently falſe: for to admit theſe Churches were at the firſt but one ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Congregation, yet doth it not at all follow that therefore primitively they were independent, and ſtood not under any other Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves. Both our Engliſh Church here, and generally other Reformed Churches in theſe countries were in their firſt conſtitution, and for the moſt part ſtill are but one ordinary Congregation; and yet from the firſt ſtood under the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall authority of Claſſes and Synods, in which they were combined. III. Suppoſe ſome of the Churches either in <hi>Euſebius</hi> time or in later times, did not at their firſt conſtitution ſtand under the authority of Synods, when Churches being ſo few, and ſo farre diſtant, they wanted opportunity of combining themſelves together for their mutuall aſſiſtance; this hinders not but that upon the encreaſe of neighbour Churches they might afterwards ſubmit themſelves unto this order. IV. That the Primitive Churches whereof <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes in his hiſtory, did ſtand under another Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves, and were ſubject unto their cenſures, he makes it evident by ſundry inſtances. He<note n="h" place="margin">Eccl. Hiſt. l. 5. c. 14.</note> records how the errour of <hi>Montanus</hi> was judged and condemned by many Synods in Aſia: how<note n="i" place="margin">L. 6. c. 42.</note> 
                     <hi>Novatus</hi> and the <hi>Cathariſts</hi> were excommunicated by a Synod holden at Rome, conſiſting of 60 Biſhops, with many Elders and Deacons: how<note n="k" place="margin">L. 7. c. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Paulus Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> was depoſed and excommunicated by a Synod holden at Antioch. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares<note n="l" place="margin">De vita Conſt. l. 3. c. 6, 7, &amp;c.</note> at large and celebrates the piety of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the great friend &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of Chriſtian religion, for aſſembling the Nicene Synod, wherein <hi>Arius</hi> was condemned. And in like manner he ſhewes the<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid. l. 1. c. 44.</note> impiety of the Emperour <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> the enemy of God, who by a miſchievous deviſe ſought to ruinate the Churches of God by depriving them of their liberty in meeting together in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, for deciding of their controverſies. So expreſſely and clearely doth <hi>Euſebius</hi> give teſtimony unto Synods.</p>
                  <p>That which is collected out of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> viz. that <hi>elections, excommunications, &amp;c. according to the Apoſtles precept, ought to be done in the publick Congregation by the Miniſters, they taking firſt the peoples voyce or conſent;</hi> is ſuch as I doe willingly aſſent unto. Neither was there ever any election, either of Miniſter, Elder, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, nor any excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any offender among us, but that the matter was firſt ſolemnely communicated with the Church, and declared ſeverall times in the publick Congregation, &amp; the conſent of the people required &amp; obtained before any ſuch act was confirmed &amp; finiſhed among us. But what is this to the purpoſe?
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:112189:130"/>
                     <hi>Athanaſius</hi> notwithſtanding this doth witneſſe unto us, that the cauſes and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of particular Churches, were in his time ſubmitted to the cenſure of other Churches, and to another ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves. This <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſhewes in theſe very places here alledged againſt me: And in the firſt of them, having<note n="n" place="margin">Tom. 1. Epiſt. ad ubiq. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxos.</note> made a lamentable narration of the miſeries procured to the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the intruſion and cruelty of an Arian Biſhop, he then moſt vehemently ſupplicates unto thoſe that were members of the ſame body with them in other Churches, that as the former yeare their brethren at Rome were willing to have called a Synod, but that they were hindred; ſo they having greater occaſion to vindicate the Church of God from new evills, would [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] <hi>by their ſuffrages condemne,</hi> and reject the Authors of ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes. And more plainely in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place, he declares<note n="o" place="margin">Epiſt. ad Solit. vitam agentes.</note> at length that in the Synod holden at <hi>Sardica,</hi> where <hi>Hoſius</hi> was Preſident, and whither the accuſers of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> were cited, the cauſe being heard, the Synod did not onely adviſe and counſell what was meet to be done, but did give ſentence touching the matters of controverſy, abſolved <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and depoſed the Biſhops that were found guilty, ſuch as <hi>Stephanus, Menophantus, Acacius, Georgius, Vrſacius, Valens, Theodorus, Narciſsus.</hi> As for the third allegation [<hi>Epiſt. cont. Nicae. c.</hi> 9. <hi>Ecc. Hiſt.</hi>] it ſeemes to be miſquoted: I finde no ſuch Title in all the works of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Inſtead thereof therefore, let us ſee another teſtimonie of his, wherein he teacheth what the government of the Church was in thoſe times, namely ruled by authoritie of Synods, where the weightier cauſes were judged &amp; decided. Of this he<note n="p" place="margin">Tom. 2. Epiſt. ad Ruſinian.</note> gives inſtances in the Synods of <hi>Alexandria, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> where <hi>Euzoius, Eudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xius,</hi> and ſuch principall offenders were depoſed from their offices, and other upon their repentance retained. And the like Eccleſiaſticall authority is in many other places throughout his writings by him commended unto us. Let us heare how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. proceeds.</p>
                  <p>I. C. <hi>To theſe we will adde Epiphanius, Ierome, Ambroſe, Cyrill, Hillarie and Greg. Nazianzen; writers in noe age. Touching Eccleſiaſticall Government, theſe to this purpoſe ſpeake:</hi> Particular Churches may lawfully ordaine their owne Biſhops, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preſbyters aſſiſting them; <hi>Epiph. cont. Haer.</hi> 73. and among themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate offenders. <hi>Id. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 30. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Haer.</hi> 5. ANSVV. I. Here be three places at once miſalledged: In the two latter, viz. <hi>Haer.</hi> 30. and <hi>Haer.</hi> 5. there is nothing at all ſpoken touching this poynt. In the firſt of them, viz. <hi>Haer.</hi> 73. he doth but catch at a ſhadow, and pervert the words of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them, by changing ſome and adding other, and omitting other that might give light unto the queſtion. His words upon occaſion of <hi>Meletius</hi> his confeſſion and ſuffering for the trueth, are theſe; <hi>There are many people of this order of this Synod, which ſetting Biſhops over themſelves, doe make a marvellous confeſſion touching the faith, &amp; doe not reject the word Coeſsentiall. Yea and ſay they are ready, if there were a perfect Synod, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe &amp; not to deny it.</hi> Here is no mention of <hi>particular Churches</hi> or Congregations; nor of <hi>lawfully ordayning,</hi> nor of doing this <hi>without other Preſbyters aſſiſting them.</hi> But that which is recorded touching the acknowledgement of a lawfull or <hi>perfect Synod,</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:112189:130"/>that is omitted. Thus he varyeth from the Latine tranſlation of <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> the Originall Greek in divers Copies is further from the matter; having this beſide other differences, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>which made themſelves to be Biſhops,</hi> inſtead of lawfully ordaining their owne Biſhops. Such are the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne. II. Suppoſe the words <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had bene the ſame that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. relates, yet had not the authority of Synods bene any thing diminiſhed thereby. Is it not the common and ordinary practiſe in theſe Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that where two or more Miniſters are in one Congregation, there the newly elected Miniſters are ordained and confirmed without any other Preſbyters from other Churches to aſſiſt them? Yet this is no good argument to prove they want Claſſes and Synods. And though alſo they doe among themſelves excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate offenders; yet this hinders not but that Claſſes or Synods may exerciſe their authority in judging or cenſuring ſuch as have unjuſtly excommunicated any, or proceeded contrary to their adviſe therein. III. That <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did approve the authority and juriſdiction of Synods, it is manifeſt by his practiſe. It is<note n="q" place="margin">Socrat. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 6. c. 9.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him that he being Biſhop of <hi>Salamis</hi> or <hi>Conſtantia</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> procured a Synod to be called in that Iland, wherein the bookes of <hi>Origen</hi> were condemned, &amp; a decree made that none ſhould read his bookes. IV. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve the lawfull authority of Synods; but he went further and did maintaine the unlawfull authoritie of particular perſons over divers Churches. This appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in his<note n="r" place="margin">Epiph. Haer. 75.</note> condemning of <hi>Aërius</hi> of hereſie, that held Biſhops &amp; Preſbyters to be the ſame by divine inſtitution; whom <hi>D. Whitaker</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">De Pont. Rom. q. 1. p. 104, 105, 106.</note> doth juſtly defend againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, and ſhewes that <hi>Hierome</hi> and other ancient Fathers were of the ſame minde with <hi>Aërius</hi> therein; and ſayth that we are not to regard the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd men that doe ſo often object <hi>Aërius</hi> unto us: he ſayth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and childiſhly anſwer the teſtimonies produced by <hi>Aërius,</hi> and wonders that ſuch a Divine that tooke upon him to refute all Heretickes, did not ſee his owne foule errour. Yea it is further<note n="t" place="margin">Soc. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 6. c. 11.13.</note> recorded of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he diſorderly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded himſelf into the charge of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> contrary to the Eccleſiaſticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons obſerved in thoſe times, by celebrating the Lords ſupper &amp; ordaining a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con in the Church at Conſtantinople. And thus we ſee M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes witneſſes are in extremity oppoſite unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Another of his witneſſes is <hi>Ierome,</hi> from whom he alledgeth, that<note n="v" place="margin">Jer. ad. Gal. q. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>In every Congregation there ought to be a Senate or aſſembly of Elders.</hi> To this I anſwer, I. This is nothing againſt the authority of Synods. The Reformed Churches have in every Congregation ſuch a Senate of Elders: and yet this hinders not but that they have &amp; ought to have Claſſes &amp; Synods alſo, both for direction and correction of Elderſhips, and for deciſion of the controverſies ariſing in particular Churches. II. Though every Congregation ought to have a Senate of Elders; yet <hi>Ierome</hi> doth not avouch ſo much in the place alledged. His words are falſifyed: for in the place which they miſquote (<hi>ad Gal.</hi> inſtead of <hi>ad Alg.</hi>) the words of Jerome are theſe,<note n="x" place="margin">Ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſ. qu. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>How great the traditions of the Phariſees are, which at this day they call</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and what old wives fables, I cannot expreſſe. For neither doth the greatnes of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:112189:131"/>booke permit: and many of them are ſo filthy, that</hi> I <hi>bluſh to tell. And yet</hi> (ſaith he) I <hi>will tell one of them, to the ignominy of that envyous nation. They have Rulers in their Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, of their wiſest men, deputed unto a filthy work, &amp;c.</hi> What this filthy work was, though Jerome expreſſe it, yet I thinke it ſhame to publiſh. And this which he ſaith in deteſtation of the Jewes, without approbation of their order, is all that he there ſaith for an aſſembly of Elders. So vaine and inſufficient are the Allegations of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne. III. That Hierome allowed the authority of Synods above par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, it may appeare by that he ſayth,<note n="y" place="margin">Ad Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griu ep. 85.</note> 
                     <hi>Si authoritas quaeritur, orbis major est urbe. If we ſeek for authority, greater is the world then the city;</hi> that is, as D. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker expounds the ſame, the Churches diſperſed through the world: he ſayth,<note n="z" place="margin">De Pont. Rom. qu. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>All the authority of the Church of Rome, is not ſo great as is the authority of all Churches every where.</hi> And thereby he acknowledgeth the authority of Synods ariſing from the deputation of many Churches, to be greater then the ſingle authority of any one particular Church. Beſides, whereas <hi>Damaſus,</hi> Biſhop of Rome, was a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous oppoſite to the Arian, Macedonian, and other hereſies, and in divers Synods furthered the cenſure and condemnation of ſuch as perſiſted in thoſe errours, and wrote divers Synodicall Epiſtles which witneſſe the exerciſe of that authority by Synods, <hi>Hierome</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Ad Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontiam.</note> confeſſeth that in the writing of thoſe Synodall letters he did aſſiſt and help <hi>Damaſus,</hi> which he could not with good conſcience have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had allowed the authority of Synods. Laſtly, if <hi>Hierome</hi> wrote that in every particular Congregation there ought to be a Senate or aſſembly of Elders; then is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne and his Congregation condemned by <hi>Hierome,</hi> becauſe they have now for many yeares had no Senate nor aſſembly of Elders, to governe them; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne being ſole governour of them, without an Elderſhip.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, touching this aſſembly of Elders, he addes, that <hi>The power of chooſing them is in the people.</hi> And for this he alledgeth three Authours together,<note n="b" place="margin">Ad Ruſt. Hil. ad Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt. Auguſt. Cyr. in Ioh. 20.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Hierome, Hilarie, Cyrill.</hi> I anſwer: For <hi>Hierome, ad Ruſticum;</hi> there is nothing at all ſpoken touching the matter, but he is falſely alledged. For <hi>Hilary,</hi> I. He is alſo falſely alledged: he ſayth nothing touching the Senate or aſſembly of Elders, of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. ſpeakes. II. Though he entreat <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Arian Emperour, who had baniſhed many worthy Biſhops, <hi>that he would permit the people to heare thoſe Teachers and Miniſters of the Sacraments, whom they would, whom they thought good, and whom they had choſen, that they might offer up prayers for his ſafety and felicity;</hi> yet doth he not hereby prejudice the authority and juriſdiction of Synods. This hinders not but that Synods might cenſure and judge of the elections made by the people, and of other controverſies of particular Churches. III. <hi>Hilary</hi> alſo<note n="c" place="margin">Cent. Magdeb. Cent. 4. c. 10 col. 1134, 1135.</note> wrote a peculiar booke touching Synods, exſtant among his workes, which he had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated out of Greek into Latine, wherein the Acts and decrees of divers Synods that cenſured and condemned the Arian hereſy, are recorded. Had he thought with my oppoſites, that this juriſdiction of Synods had bene an uſurped and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull power; he ought not to have given ſo much approbation of them, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their authority for defenſe of his opinion, without ſome teſtification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their power. Beſides, what colour of reaſon hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. to ſhew that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius</hi> ſhould vary from the judgement of Orthodox Biſhops, who in that age
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:112189:131"/>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Ib. Cent. 4. c. 7. col. 519. &amp; 528 &amp;c.</note> ordinarily uſed to meet together in Synods for the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction?</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Cyrill</hi> in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.21. whom he alſo brings to prove that the Senate or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Elders, ought to be choſen by the people, he is in like manner abuſed and falſely alledged by him. For I. <hi>Cyrill</hi> upon thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> ſayth that Chriſt <hi>in thoſe words ordained the Teachers of the world, and Miniſters of the divine myſteries, &amp;c. That therefore Paul is true, ſaying, No man takes this honour unto himſelf, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhewes how Chriſt called his Diſciples, but hath not a word, neither touching an aſſembly of Elders, nor of their chooſing by the people. Such falſhood and forgery there is in the Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. And yet if he had ſpoken as much as is here pretended, it had bene no empeachment unto the authority of Synods, as was ſhewed before. II. That this <hi>Cyrill,</hi> Biſhop of Alexandria, did acknowledge the uſe of Synods, not onely for counſell and admonition, but for cenſure and judgement of cauſes, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth evidently by his practiſe, while in the<note n="e" place="margin">Euagr. Hiſt. Eccl. l. 1. c. 4.</note> Synod holden at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> he being a principall member of that Synod, did together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give ſentence againſt <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and depoſed him from his office, for his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in refuſing to appeare before them, and for his hereſy whereof he had bene convicted.</p>
                  <p>The next witneſſe abuſed by him is <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who is alledged to ſhew what the Senate or aſſembly of Elders is to doe, viz.<note n="f" place="margin">Amb. Offi. l. 1. c. 1</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe with ſpirituall bridles order men, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer: I. In the place alledged, there is not a word to be found, either touching a Senate of Elders, or touching ſpirituall bridles, or any thing to like purpoſe. II. If a Senate of Elders be ſpirituall bridles, then the Browniſts with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. that now want ſuch a Senate, are an unbridled company, wanting order, &amp;c. III. What though an aſſembly of Elders order men with ſpirituall bridles? Is there therefore no other ſpirituall bridle in the authority of Synods? What conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is this? IV.

                     <q>It may ſeeme ſtrange that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> denyes he had ſeene a good iſſue of any Synod. For in thoſe two Synods, [viz. of Nice and Conſtantinople, which had beene mentioned before,] trueth got the victory, and hereſy was put downe. And though it be certaine, that Arianiſme was encreaſed and grew ſtrong and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Church after the Synod of Nice, more then before, yet that is not to be imputed to the Synod, but to the contention and ambition of men. For as our corrupt nature doth more vehemently reſiſt the knowne law of God, and ruſheth headlong unto ſinne: ſo falſhood oppoſed itſelf more boldly unto the trueth then explained and openly defended, whereupon after that Synod, which none excelled, greater inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities did ariſe from the wickedneſs of men, &amp;c. When <hi>Nazianz.</hi> ſaw ſo wicked diſpoſitions of men, he was wholly turned from Councels. Although without doubt he diſallowed not the thing itſelf, but the wicked indeavours of men. Now if any will reaſon after this manner, The iſſue of Synods is not good, or more evils follow thence; therefore Synods are to be avoyded: that man ſhall diſpute deceitfully from a wrong cauſe, from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and from the fallacy of conſequent. But <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was to be pardoned, becauſe he lived in the worſt and moſt turbulent times of the Church, when by meanes of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour that degenerated from the Catholick faith, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks did more prevayle, &amp;c.</q> Againe he oppoſeth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> unto <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> and ſayth, <q>It is moſt true which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 118. that <hi>the authority of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods in the Church of God is moſt wholeſome,</hi> which certainly he would not have ſayd, if he had bene of the ſame minde with <hi>Nazianzen.</hi>
                     </q> And further he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:112189:132"/>unto the ſpeech of <hi>Nazianz.</hi> the teſtimony of Chriſt, ſaying, <q>Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pronounceth and promiſeth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his name, there he will be in the midſt of them.</hi> In which words he ſignifyeth that the aſſemblies and Synods of godly and religious men, undertaken and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for godly cauſes, are not diſpleaſing unto him.</q> III. The teſtimony of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is as much againſt the opinion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dav. as againſt that which we hold touching Claſſes and Synods. For ſeeing they allow ſuch mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for counſell and admonition, though not for exerciſe of any juriſdiction; and ſeeing the teſtimony of <hi>Nazia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> doth extend itſelf to all kinde of aſſemblies of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] whether for counſell or cenſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception of one ſort more then another: therefore he no more condemneth our Synods, then thoſe which my oppoſites allow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> his next witneſſe, is in like manner perverted as the former. Though he in the place<note n="(t)" place="margin">DeDoct. Chr. l. 1. c. 17.</note> objected, doe write that <hi>the keyes were given to the Church;</hi> yet doth he not thereby exclude Synods gathered together in the name of Chriſt, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a keye of power in the judgement of Eccleſiaſticall cauſes. Had he proved that the title of the <hi>Church</hi> belongs onely to a particular Congregation in the full aſſembly thereof, and not at all unto a Synod, then had it bene ſomething to the purpoſe; in the meane time, nothing. And that the minde of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it appeares by the great approbation which he<note n="(v)" place="margin">Epiſt. ad Ianuar. Ep. 118. De Bapt. cont. Don. l. 2. c. 3.</note> gives unto the uſe and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Synods, as being <hi>moſt wholeſome</hi> in the Churches of God. <hi>D. Whitaker</hi>
                     <note n="(x)" place="margin">DePont. Rom. q. 4. p. 484. &amp; 497</note> alledgeth often the preſence of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at divers Synods. And it is recorded in the Acts of the third Councell of Carthage, where <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was both preſent, and ſubſcribed with the reſt unto the decrees which were then agreed upon,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Magdeb. Cent. 4. c. 9. co. 866, 867.</note> that there ſhould be kept a yearely Synod, unto which they were to repaire out of divers Provinces; that thoſe which having controverſies with others, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the yearely Synod, did refuſe to come, ſhould be held guilty, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the communion, or excommunicated. And it is<note n="(z)" place="margin">Ib.

Hence it appeares that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> as well as others in his time, did hold that the cauſes of particular Congregations were to be judged &amp; decided by another Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>After Auguſtine he alledgeth <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whoſe name is alſo abuſed for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this opinion. For, I. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in the place alledged, viz. <hi>De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. ſpeakes of no ſuch matter as he pretends. In that whole third book I finde no one word againſt the authority of Synods. And for the fourth chapter, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. alledgeth, there is in the beſt editions of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> no ſuch chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they are not at all diſtinguiſhed into any Chapters: and where there is a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chapters found, yet there is no ſuch matter to be found in that fourth Chapter. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne, it ſeemes, never read the Authours he alledgeth: for would he then have ſo falſely cited them? II. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is plaine for the authority of Synods. For ſpeaking of the honour due unto the Deputies or meſſengers of the Churches in Synods, he ſaith the Apoſtle,<note n="(a)" place="margin">In 2. Cor. 8.24.</note> 
                     <hi>maketh his ſpeech more terrible, ſaying</hi> in

When as a wrongfull ſentence had bene given againſt Chryſoſtome, being unjuſtly procured by <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Biſhop of Alexandria, he then<note n="(b)" place="margin">Tom. 5.

The ſumme of his defence afterward was this, that he was willing to be judged by a Synod. And he complaines that his adverſaries dealt with him, contrary to the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Canons.</hi> In thoſe Canons it had bene oft decreed, that there ſhould be liberty of appeale unto Synods. IV. When <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleading for the Popes authority, alledged the requeſt of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> unto <hi>Innocentius,</hi> Biſhop of Rome, deſiring him to write for him, that thoſe things which were unjuſtly done againſt him, might not prevayle, &amp;c. <hi>Chamierus</hi> expounding the words of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>

More particularly, in his firſt Epiſtle which he wrote unto <hi>Eugenius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was created Pope, upon occaſion of the controverſy that was betwixt the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> &amp; the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he puts this Pope in minde that he<note n="(x)" place="margin">Bernar. ad Eugen.

It is acknowledged by the Miniſters of the Church of the <hi>Picards</hi> (ſo called) in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> in the<note n="(e)" place="margin">P. 219.</note> preface to the forementioned Confeſſion of their fayth, that their fathers had appealed unto a Synod &amp;c. where if any thing ſhould be found diſſonant from the Scriptures, <hi>they were willing from the heart and lovingly to be ſubject and obedient to the cenſure and appointment of the Synod in all things.</hi> This ſhewes their diſſent from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne and his people.

To ordaine Miniſters, &amp;c. and for the<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ib. p. 41.</note> examination of Miniſters before they be confirmed. The exerciſe of this authority is alſo declared in their<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ib. cap. 6. p. 87, 88. &amp;c.</note> Viſitations of the Churches which are in their <hi>Vnitie</hi> or conſociation. This example of theſe brethren of the <hi>Vnitie,</hi> is ſo much the more to be regarded of us in reſpect of the ſingular providence &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, in preſerving them to this day, in the midſt of ſo many perſecutions as they have endured, being more ancient then other Reformed Churches, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continued from the dayes of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> and being holpen by the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> that were ſcattered into thoſe parts; ſo that they<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ib. pref. p. 2, 3.</note> were increaſed to almoſt 200 lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Congregations in <hi>Bohemia</hi> &amp; <hi>Moravia,</hi> about the yeare 1500, before the time of <hi>Luther.</hi> Their piety, love, concord, and zeale of religion, notwithſtanding ſome imperfections, appeares by their orders to be very great; in ſpeciall, their care of ſanctifying the Sabbath, beſtowing it wholly in divine and religious exerciſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting<note n="(k)" place="margin">Ib. cap. 3. p. 54. &amp; 72, 73.</note> foure times a day to the publick aſſemblies of Gods worſhip, even in the Winter time, and in Summer, five times a day, &amp;c. The bond of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which they ſeek for, and have in ſome meaſure attained unto, ſeemes to be their combination in Synods, and that unity therein whereupon they are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Their government and the fruits thereof have bene ſuch, that many of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:112189:135"/>ſpeciall lights of Chriſtendome, ſince the time of Reformation, have admited and commended the ſame, and ſundry of them have wiſhed for the like Diſcipline and order in the Churches where they lived; as appeares by the teſtimonies of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Bucer, Pet. Paulus Vergerius, Beza, Zanchius, Olevian, Vrſinus, Chytraeus, Pet. Martyr, Calvin, Polanus, Bucholcerus,</hi> which teſtimonies are<note n="(l)" place="margin">P. 106-122.</note> affixed unto the end of that book of their Diſcipline. Yea the printing of this book of their Diſcipline (according to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon order in ſuch caſes) was not done without the<note n="(m)" place="margin">Pref. p. 8. &amp; 16.</note> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Synod, &amp; namely of that which was celebrated at <hi>Leſsna in Poland, anno</hi> 1632. they being by the preſent troubles diſperſed abroad into thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Unto that which he had alledged out of the Bohemian Confeſſion, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne ſaith <hi>the Churches under the Palſgrave likewiſe conſented:</hi> and to this end he citeth their <hi>Publick Catechiſme in the end of part</hi> 2. For anſwer hereunto; 1. If theſe Churches conſent unto that which the Bohemian Churches have profeſſed, then they doe not agree with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can. as appeares by what hath bene ſayd in the foregoing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. 11. The place here alledged hath nothing touching the perſons to whom the Keyes are given, which is the thing for which it is produced; it ſpeakes onely of the uſe of the Keyes, and the ordinary exerciſe of Diſcipline in the Church, without reſtraining the ſame unto the ſole juriſdiction of a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or excluding the authority of Claſſes and Synods, either for adviſe &amp; conſent before hand, or for the correcting of abuſes committed in the adminiſtration of it. And that the power of a ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall judicatorie, exerciſed in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is agreeable unto the doctrine and practiſe of the Churches in the Palatinate, may appeare from the teſtimonies<note n="(n)" place="margin">P. 191.192.193.</note> before noted out of <hi>Vrſinus, Toſſanus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus,</hi> Divines of ſpeciall eminencie in thoſe Churches. III. Whereas it is ſayd in this Catechiſme,<note n="(o)" place="margin">Qu. 85.</note> concerning Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, that offenders after other admonitions perſiſting in their errors and wickednes, are to be <hi>made knowne unto the Church;</hi> leſt this ſhould be underſtood of the whole multitude, it is added preſently, <hi>or to them that are appoynted for that matter and purpoſe of the Church: and if neither then they obey their admonition, are of the ſame men, by forbidding them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhut out from the aſſembly of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is, as it is explained<note n="(p)" place="margin">Explic. Catech. ad Qu. 85.</note> by <hi>Vrſinus</hi> (who alſo yeelded ſpeciall help for the compiling of that Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me) that when any is to be excommunicated, the matter be firſt heard, tryed, and judged by <hi>the whole Preſbyterie, and that their judgement be approved by the Church; that it be not undertaken by the private authoritie of one alone, or of the Miniſters alone.</hi> This ſerves to juſtifie what we teach and practiſe, and to condemne both the tyrannicall and popular courſes of others. IV. Moreover for the judgement and practiſe of the Churches in the Palatinate, concerning the authority of Claſſes &amp; Synods, which is the poynt in controverſy, it is to be obſerved, that all the Miniſters which according to order are there confirmed in the Miniſterie, are as a Jurie of ſo many ſworne men, bearing witneſſe againſt the Independencie of Churches. For at their ordination they doe not onely teſtify and promiſe by ſubſcription and giving of of the hand, but withall they doe binde themſelves by a ſolemne oath, among the reſt,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Churf.

I declare alſo and proteſt that I reject and condemne the doctrine of the Arminians, ſeeing it doth hang the election of God upon the will of man, diminiſheth and diſannulleth the grace of God, exalts man and the ſtrength of his free will to caſt him downe from above, brings in againe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſme, excuſeth Popery, and overthrowes the certainty of ſalvation.

Hereby the Reader may perceave what power and authority is exerciſed in the Reformed Churches of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:112189:137"/>France; that they doe not obſerve their Synods for to conclude matters by way of adviſe and counſell onely, but by their decrees and ordinances doe binde men to ſubmit unto their ſentence and judgement, excluding thoſe from the miniſtery, &amp; profeſſions in Univerſities or Schooles, that refuſe to conſent and yeeld unto their reſolutions.

For the reſt, whoſe cognition is not come to this Nationall Synod, it committeth unto Provinciall Synods, Claſſes &amp; Preſbyteries, according to the order receaved, that with all care they procure, &amp;c. That they diligently take heed unto
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:112189:140"/>themſelves, that they admit not any man to the holy miniſtery, which refuſeth to ſubſcribe unto the doctrine declared in theſe Synodicall conſtitutions, and to teach the ſame: that they alſo retaine no man by whoſe manifeſt diſſenſion, &amp;c.</q>

                  <p>This judgement &amp; Sentence of the Synod was afterward in moſt full &amp; ample manner<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 282.</note> approved &amp; confirmed by the Illuſtrious Lords, the States Generall of the United Provinces, acknowledging alſo the buſineſſe of this Synod to be <hi>agreat &amp; holy work, ſuch as heretofore the Reformed Churches never ſaw, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Moreover it is memorable, that the members of this Synod, the Deputies of ſeverall Churches, did all &amp; every one of them take a moſt ſolemne oath, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the good conſcience which they had in the exerciſe of this authority: The forme of the Oath was<note n="(l)" place="margin">Act.

                  <p>
                     <q>I doe promiſe before God, whom I beleeve and reverence as the preſent ſearcher of the reines and hearts, that in this whole Synodall action, wherein ſhalbe undertaken an examination, judgement &amp; deciſion, both touching the five knowne Articles and the difficulties thence ariſing, and alſo touching all other matters of doctrine, I will not take any humane writings, but onely the word of God for the certaine &amp; undoubted rule of faith; and that in this whole cauſe I ſhall propound nothing to my ſelf, but the glory of God, the peace of his Church, and in ſpeciall the conſervation of the purity of doctrine. So let my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt be mercifull unto me, whom I moſt earneſtly beſeech that he would continually aſſiſt me in this purpoſe with the grace of his Spirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This oath being firſt taken by the Preſident of the Synod, all the other Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, Paſtours &amp; Elders of the Netherlands, deputed unto the Synod, and then all the Divines of other nations, ſtanding up in order, did with a loud voyce every one of them declare, that they did holily promiſe and ſweare before God the ſame thing: and teſtifyed that they came with ſuch minde unto the Synod; had hitherto ſit downe therein; and would hereafter by the grace of God continue.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſuch a cloud of witneſſes conſenting with me, I have reaſon in this place againe to put M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne in minde of his vaine boaſting<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 83.</note> touching <hi>a Iurie of more then</hi> 24. <hi>men</hi> condemning me of errour.

            <head>A Supplement, annexed by the Publiſher, for anſwer unto that vvhich follovveth in Mr Cannes booke.</head>
            <p>THus farre, good Reader, the Authour hath travelled through thoſe tedious wayes, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. though with leſſe trouble, yet with more prejudice to his owne cauſe, hath firſt opened unto him. The ſumme of all is, that wading through thoſe ſtreames of Arguments and Reaſons wich M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. had let out upon him, he hath found ſuch as were of any depth, to runne another way; &amp; the other too ſhallow to hinder the paſſage of trueth in this controverſie. And marching through thoſe ſeverall rankes &amp; files of learned Authours, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. had muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; brought into the field for his defence and aſſiſtance in this conflict, he hath found them all (excepting thoſe that were to be excepted) to be friends inſtead of enemies, teſtifying plainely in their owne words, &amp; in the words of ſundry others with them, that againſt their wills they were forced to appeare under his banners. And therefore in the ſame order that he marſhalled them againſt the <hi>Authority of Synods,</hi> they now ſtand in aray againſt the <hi>Independency of Churches.</hi> There remained yet one part of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Can. oppoſition in this cauſe to be encountred, wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to diſappoint and conquer ſuch forces as might ſeeme to be uſed in defence of that Claſſicall and Synodall government which he hath hitherto oppugned. To this end he<note n="(a)" place="margin">Chur. plea, p. 92.</note> undertakes to anſwer certaine Reaſons or Objections, picked out of divers paſſages in the Authours<note n="(b)" place="margin">Anſw. to W.B. &amp;c</note> firſt booke, ſuppoſing by this meanes to have fully acquitted himſelf in this Diſpute. Now though there be nothing in theſe his Anſwers, for which an intelligent Reader might not eaſily ſatiſfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from what hath beene ſayd already in the foregoing Treatiſe: yet leſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. ſhould plead there was ought left untouched, that with any ſhew of reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an anſwer; &amp; for their help to whom ſuch directions may be uſefull, I have here briefly noted what he hath ſayd, and to what purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons or Objections which in this latter part of his booke he aſſayeth to anſwer, are 1. Concerning the evill conſequents of Independency: 2. The ancient exerciſe of the power uſed in Synodall combinations: 3. The liberty &amp; freedome hence ariſing unto Churches &amp; the members thereof: 4. The deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Synods, and conſent of Reformed Churches in this matter: 5. The Authours alledging the former practiſe of the Church where he was Miniſter. In the ſixt place he mentioneth ſome objections, of which he<note n="(c)" place="margin">Church. pl. p. 100.</note> ſaith he <hi>will not ſtand to make any particular anſwer thereto;</hi> but referreth us in generall to the writings of others, which whoſoever ſhall compare with the Authours words againſt which they are applyed, and duely weigh the ſeverall circumſtances on both ſides, may eaſily diſcerne that this his generall anſwer needs no reply. In the end leſt we ſhould doubt with what affection all the reſt was written, he graceth his booke with this Concluſion, and <hi>diſireth</hi> it <hi>may be noted,</hi> when out of the abundance of his charity he ſaith, <hi>Mr Paget would faine have the Claſſicall Diſcipline advanced, that hee by it might have worldly credit alſo:</hi> Theſe are his laſt words, uſhered with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:112189:141"/>others of the ſame ſtamp; <hi>that hee ſeeks to diſgrace Chriſts government, &amp; to have his owne honoured &amp; embraced, &amp;c.</hi> A vile ſlander, &amp; not worthy to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>For the other objections which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canne pretends to anſwer, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Authour in his former writing hath not framed any Reaſons for proofe of this poynt in controverſie, as he hath often<note n="(d)" place="margin">Pag. 40, 73. 168.</note> before noted in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. It was not his purpoſe at that time to propound any Argument, firſt or laſt, but being the Defendant or partie accuſed, to wait for the Arguments of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. And ſo much was alſo ſignifyed in his<note n="(e)" place="margin">Anſw. to W. B. p. 71. 88.</note> other booke, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. had read, and from whence thoſe Reaſons or pretences, as he calles them, are taken, unto which here he ſhapes his Anſwers. Yet notwithſtanding he will take no notice of this, but runnes into two contrary extremes: before he affirmed that he brought no proofes, becauſe he had none to bring; intimating<note n="(f)" place="margin">Chur. pl. p. 15. 16.</note> that he <hi>hath not left this point unprooved, out of forgetfulnes; but rather of meere poverty, as not having any authenticall records, &amp;c.</hi> Here againe he makes him to bring Reaſons &amp; Arguments, when as he profeſſed that at that time he intended to bring none: not out of forgetfulnes, or want of ability; for he had ſayd in the place before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he had to this purpoſe <hi>in his Sermons divers times alledged ſundry evidences &amp; grounds of holy Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. knew that he was able to produce ſuch evidences, by the occaſionall mentioning of thoſe two places, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 15. which he hath alſo undertaken to anſwer. Come we now to the particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> THe firſt pretended Reaſon is ſet downe by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. in theſe words: <hi>If particular Congregations ſhould not ſtand under any other Eccleſiaſticall authoritie out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, manifold diſorders, confuſion and diſſipation of Churches would follow.</hi> Thus he perverts the Authours words, which were not ſet downe by way of Argument, but meerly as a declaration of his judgement touching the benefit of Claſſes and Synods, againſt the contrary accuſation of his oppoſites. His words are theſe,<note n="(g)" place="margin">Anſw. to W. B. Pref.</note> 
               <hi>That ſingle uncompounded policie (as Mr Iacob calles it) whereby particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made to be independent, not ſtanding under any other Eccleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves, that I conceive to bring with it manifold diſorders, confuſion and diſſipation of Churches.</hi> That which the Authour thus ſet downe as his owne opinion, which he held concerning the ſafety of this government, for the maintaining of order &amp; ſetled peace in Churches; that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. tranſformes into an Argument, &amp; calles it his <hi>firſt reaſon.</hi> The Authour had juſt cauſe to mention that conſideration in ſuch manner as he did, to ſhew the importance of this point in controverſie, by which he there alſo hoped that others would be warned, to <hi>take heed what new formes of Churches and Church-government they frame unto themſelves, or commend unto others.</hi> Experience hath taught, not once, nor twice, that in the matter of framing Churches, for want of taking ſuch advice, ſome have become like Vtopian Commonwealths men; going to work according to their owne <hi>Idaeas,</hi> they have begun a work which they were not able to finiſh; not unlike unto that builder of whom our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28, 29, 30. And therefore, as before more briefly, ſo now<note n="(h)" place="margin">Pag. 32, 33.</note> at his entrance into a more full and profeſſed handling of this queſtion, the Authour hath hereby declared of what importance this controverſy is, and given inſtance in the diſorders, confuſions and diſſipations which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:112189:142"/>unto that Church of the Browniſts at Amſterdam, the rather becauſe of their neglect and contempt of ſuch remedies, as from Claſſicall and Synodall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might have been afforded unto them. If thoſe that pretend ſuch accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe of Diſcipline, have fallen into ſo great and manifold ſcandals, ſuch raſh and offenſive excommunications, ſchiſmes, &amp; depoſitions, as are there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; how can it be expected that others, in outward appearance more unable to mannage ſuch a kinde of government, ſhould be free from running into the like or greater offences? If ſome few ſingle Churches, within a few yeares, have bewrayed to their loſſe and ſhame, the great want of a combined government, for the eſtabliſhment of peace and order among them; how many inſtances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſame kinde might we looke for in proceſſe of time, where many Churches together ſhould be erected according to this modell of Independent politie? To this purpoſe the Authour hath applyed that obſervation touching theſe evill conſequents of Independency; not by way of argument, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. hath ſet it downe. If he had intended to propound an Argument, he would have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it after another manner, for the aggravation of their errour; as thus for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>That independency of Churches, which not being preſcribed of God, doth occaſion mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſorders, &amp;c. that is ſo much the more to be avoyded: But ſuch is that Independency which is required of theſe Oppoſites: Ergo.</hi> Or thus; <hi>That Independency of Churches, which not by accident onely, but in the very nature thereof, is a proper cauſe of manifold diſorders, is to be condemned: But ſuch is that Independency taught by theſe Oppoſites: Ergo.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thus propounded, and underſtood principally of more Churches of this frame ſeated together (where the diſorders enſuing would be more apparent, and the neglect of the remedy more culpable) hath ſufficient grounds, both of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon, to uphold it. Firſt, there being required a communion betwixt Churches, as well as betwixt members of one Church, as hath been noted<note n="(i)" place="margin">Pag. 109.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſeeing God is not <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, the principles of nature &amp; common equity, as they may be read in the practiſe of all times and places, doe teach that no humane ſocieties can ſubſiſt together without theſe bonds of combination &amp; confederacy; whereby it comes to paſſe that families unite themſelves and grow together into greater Corporations, Cities, Provinces, Commonwealths, and Kingdomes, for their mutuall peace and ſafety in the way of government. The ſubordination of Courts in Civill government, while they are framed according to an Ariſtocraticall temper, is not repugnant unto the nature of Eccleſiaſticall politie. Theſe things thus premiſed, and applyed unto Claſſicall and Synodall combinations, it may hereby appeare how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. hath played the trifler in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle and impertinent anſwers which he hath made unto his owne frame of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon obtruded upon the Defendant. But for further ſatiſfaction, behold the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Anſwers.</p>
            <p>I. C. ANSVV. I. <hi>When God hath eſtabliſhed an order for the adminiſtration of his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:112189:142"/>owne houſe, what preſumption of man dares change it? Thinkes he that he is wiſer then the Almighty? &amp;c.</hi> REPL. I. This anſwer ſaith nothing to any part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed argument, even as he himſelf hath framed it; unleſſe it be a denyall of the Concluſion. For of changing an order that God hath eſtabliſhed, there was no mention, nor colour of any ſuch meaning, in the Authors words which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to refute. Onely the queſtion is whether Independency be that forme of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration which God hath appointed unto his Churches: This M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. with vehement aſſeverations affirmes, and complaines of them that deny it. If this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning were good, he might eaſily beat downe all objections that are made againſt his Tenet. II. Obſerve with what inſolent language he inveigheth againſt thoſe that oppoſe his opinion, as if they did ſet themſelves poynt blanck againſt that which they ſaw to be the ordinance of God. Did he thinke the Authour or others of his minde, meant to plead in ſuch manner for their judgement &amp; practiſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Claſſes and Synods? Sure M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. knew it to be otherwiſe; at leaſt by thoſe places of Scripture, which he ſaw mentioned in their defence. But herein alſo he ſhewes himſelf to be a diſciple and follower of <hi>H. Barrow,</hi> who for the ſame thing reproaching the <hi>Reformiſts,</hi> ſayth<note n="(k)" place="margin">Diſcov. p. 189. 190.</note> they <hi>would bring in a new adulterate forged government in ſhew, or rather in deſpite of Chriſts bleſſed government, which they in the pride, raſhnes, ignorance, and ſenſualitie of their fleſhly hearts, moſt miſerably innovate, corrupt and pervert, &amp;c.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. doth here in like manner multiply words to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I. C. ANSVV. II. <hi>Be it well conſidered, that God alwayes abhorreth all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of men, that are contrary to the good pleaſure of his will, revealed in his word, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. I. There is no mention made of any <hi>intentes</hi> in the ſuppoſed Reaſon: it is onely ſayd that Independency will be attended with diſorders and confuſion, &amp;c. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. therefore diſputes with his owne intentes in theſe his impertinent anſwers. II. How can God be ſayd to <hi>abhorre good intentes?</hi> Or how can thoſe be ſayd to be <hi>good</hi> intentes, that are <hi>contrary</hi> to the revealed will of God? III. Intention notes the purpoſe of the will, with reference both unto the end at which it aimes, and the meanes by which it endeavours to attaine that end. If both theſe be good &amp; lawfull, the intention alſo is abſolutely good. Yet if the end be good, though the meanes be unwarrantable, the intention is not preſently abhorred, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time commended of God himſelf; as in David, when he purpoſed to build an houſe for the Name of the Lord, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8.18. <hi>with</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7. But in this caſe, on their part that maintaine Claſſicall and Synodall combinations, not onely the end they aime at, to wit, peace, order, and the eſtabliſhment of Churches; but the meanes alſo, or the practiſe of ſuch combinations, is allowed by the word of God: neither doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. proove ought to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I. C. ANSVV. III. <hi>This objection taken up here by Mr Paget, is the very ſame which the Papiſts, and thoſe that way affected uſe, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. I. If Papiſts uſe the <hi>very ſame</hi> objection, that is, if from the ſame Premiſſes they make the ſame Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, rejecting Independency &amp; Anti-Synodall courſes, becauſe of the confuſions and diſorders which doe follow the ſame; then herein they are no Papiſts, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Proteſtants have reaſoned in like manner, as may be ſeen in ſundry Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:112189:143"/>before<note n="(l)" place="margin">Ch. 7. Sect. 2-7.</note> alledged. II. When Papiſts diſpute againſt any lawfull forme of government, with the ſame argument which we uſe againſt that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; this can no more prejudice our reaſoning then it doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cannes, while both he &amp; they reaſon againſt lawfull Synods, as taking away that right and power which they pretend to be due unto others; he aſſcribing that to the body of the Congregation, which they doe<note n="(m)" place="margin">Bellar. de Rom. Pont l. 4. c. 1. &amp; de Verb.

            <p>I. C. ANSVV. IV. <hi>If particular Congregations muſt looſe their right and power, becauſe of the offences, which ſome men have committed in the exerciſe thereof. Then ſurely by the ſame reaſon (if Mr Pagets reaſoning be worth any thing) ought Claſses and Synods, to lay downe that ſuperiour authority, which they have taken over many Churches; becauſe they in many things, many times have offended, in and about the execution.</hi> REPL. I. The reaſon here mentioned by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. is a meere fiction and forgerie of his owne. The Author never reaſoned on this manner: he never ſayd, never thought to ſay, that particular Congregations <hi>muſt looſe their right &amp; power, &amp;c.</hi> There is no ſhadow of any ſuch thing in thoſe words which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. hath here ſet downe for himſelf to anſwer. II. Particular Congregations doe ſtill retaine their due right &amp; power, even while they are ſubordinate unto the ſuperiour authority of Claſſes and Synods, as hath been often ſhewed<note n="(n)" place="margin">Pag. 156. 157. &amp;c. 164. &amp;c.</note> before. III. If he would have ſpoken to the purpoſe, he ſhould have ſhewed, that particular Congregations, ſtanding under no other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall authority out of themſelves, are not thereby expoſed to manifold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, confuſion, and diſſipation: Or if he would have retorted this argument upon the Defendant, he ought to have prooved that Claſſicall and Synodall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of its owne nature, brings with it manifold diſorders, confuſion, and diſſipation of Churches. But inſtead of this, he mentioneth onely the offences which <hi>in many things, many times</hi> have been obſerved, <hi>in &amp; about the execution.</hi> And behold what he ſaith for proofe hereof.</p>
            <p>I. C. <hi>And this I am ſure no good Chriſtian will deny, I could give divers inſtances for it; but it needs not: Onely it is not amiſse to ſet downe</hi> Nazianzens<note n="(o)" place="margin">Epiſt 42. ad Proc.</note>

I will not, nor am able to judge.</hi> ANSVV. I. If he will not nor cannot judge whether the ſame abuſes be now committed which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> complained of; it followes that he ought not to have the will nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to conclude that this government ſhould now be remooved, as it ſeemes he would inferre from ſuch a reaſon as was uſed by <hi>Nazianzen</hi> for his diſlike of the Synods of his time. II. This teſtimony of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath been ſufficiently anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="(p)" place="margin">P. 222. 223.</note> before out of <hi>D.

But to make it appeare that this is no new objection, &amp; that we need not ſeek any further anſwer unto it, loe here what others have ſayd tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſame teſtimony. <hi>Beza,</hi> among other counſels to the Emperour &amp; States
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:112189:143"/>of Germany, for the ſettling of the peace of Chriſtian Churches, doth ſpecially give advice for the celebrating of a Synod: &amp; ſeeing he doth not onely anſwer the foreſayd exception, but withall notably declare the lawfull, ancient, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe of Synodall authority, I have here ſet downe his words at large, as worthie our obſervation for this purpoſe. <q>Churches,<note n="(q)" place="margin">Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But becauſe that cannot oftentimes be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the authority of one or a few, neither happily were it meet: therefore ſince Churches began to be ſettled, the Biſhops of the Provinces did meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as often as there was need: and that according to the example of the Apoſtles, leſt any ſhould think this hath been the device of man. The Synod of the Church of Jeruſalem and Antiochia, celebrated in the Actes of the Apoſtles, is well knowne. Afterwards followed that firſt Oecumenicall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of Nice, where Eccleſiaſticall Provinces being more accurately then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily divided, this alſo was ordained, that every yeare two Provinciall Synods ſhould be gathered by the Metropolitanes: which cuſtome if it had bene dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved, certainly it is likely that many and moſt great calamities of the Church might have bene prevented. But here ſome doe object unto us, that for the moſt part diſſenſions have been rather kindled then quenched by theſe Synods, inſomuch that the famous Biſhop <hi>Nazianzene</hi> by a certaine ſentence of his hath as it were, condemned all thoſe aſſemblies. But we make no doubt to oppoſe unto this opinion, partly that Apoſtolicall example, and partly alſo the hiſtorie of things done. Indeed the Nicene Synod hath not quite allayed the furies of Arius, no nor ſome that followed after. But who ſhall therefore judge that there hath been no fruit of that Synod, which even at this very time we doe abundantly reap? Yea that Apoſtolicall Synod hath not altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Cerinthus and thoſe obſtinate maintainers of Circumciſion. But who would therefore deny that it was neceſſary for the Church? Therefore every one ſees that that ſentence of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> doth not concerne Synods rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, unleſſe we thinke that he would detract from the Synod of Nice: which indeed is very abſurd, ſeeing it is well knowne how great a defender he hath been thereof. If nevertheleſſe Arians ceaſed not to rage through the world, how much the more may we thinke that they would have done it, if the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that holy Synod agreeing whith the word of God, ſo often objected againſt them, had not repreſſed their renewed endeavours? The ſame we avouch concerning the Macedonians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, and their iſſue, whom as many Oecumenicall Synods, if not with one wound, yet with reiterated blowes have by the word of God ſtricken downe, inſomuch that they doe afford us armes againſt the ſame, ſpringing up againe in this our age. Yet when we ſay theſe things, we doe not hold that the Church is grounded upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſuch Aſſemblies, or that all Conventicles, by whatſoever name they be called, are to be accounted Synods: but this one thing we ſay, that God is to be intreated by us in theſe calamities of the Church, that we may duely and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:112189:144"/>holily uſe theſe remedies alſo which are given unto us of God.</q> Thus farre <hi>Beza.</hi> The ſame objection out of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> is to like purpoſe anſwered by <hi>Vrſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> when he ſaith,<note n="(r)" place="margin">Admon. de lib Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. c. 12.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:112189:144"/>yet they doe not ſimply allow of Independencie. 11. Suppoſe that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration had been alledged by the Authour againſt Popular government alſo, as juſtly it might, in regard of the <hi>manifold diſorders, confuſion, and diſſipation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> which it is knowne to bring with it; yet this anſwer cannot proove it to be inſufficient, becauſe it runnes upon a twofold falſe ſuppoſition; 1.

That this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is acknowledged to have been taken from them, as if they had been once in full poſſeſſion of it; or that this is the maine reaſon for denying that pretended li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the people, becauſe of their infirmities or miſcarriages in the uſe of it. Theſe things as they are untrue in themſelves, ſo they are unjuſtly obtruded upon the Defendant, who had given no occaſion to ſuch pretences. We maintaine on the other ſide, that this is no part of the peoples priviledge, becauſe it is not due unto them by any divine warrant: and herein we are further confirmed, ſeeing ſuch an order is in outward appearance, and according to undenyable experience, in the Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, &amp; others, attended with manifold diſorders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; diſſipation of Churches. 111. Though it were granted that the people have beene oftentimes wiſer in their choyce, &amp; ſounder in the faith then their Miniſters (which yet three of thoſe places<note n="(f)" place="margin">Act. 3.26.

This is not onely contrary to experience, but alſo to the revealed will &amp; wiſedome of God, in diſpenſing his gifts ſeverally unto the members of the myſticall body of his Church, appovnting ſome to be of meaner uſe, and in ſubjection to others. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14-31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.

And ſo doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. for Independencie,<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Ch. pl. p. 76.</note> that a particular Congregation may not <hi>of a Miſtres become a ſervant; inſtead of being a ſuperiour wilfully vaſſall &amp; enſlave herſelf, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. C. ANSVV. III. I <hi>doe deny that this government by Claſses &amp; Synods ſerves better for the Churches welfare, then that which the Apoſtles inſtituted, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. And ſo wil we, when he hath prooved that Independency is the government inſtituted by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I. C. ANSVV. IV. <hi>If it ſhould be granted that particular Congregations by this kinde of government, ſhall have peace, profit, credit &amp; other worldly reſpects: yet this is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. The Defendant never uſed ſuch a reaſon: this is a ſkarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow of his owne ſetting up, and therefore we muſt give him leave to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that fivefold ſhot which he makes as it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> THe fourth reaſon which he ſuppoſeth he hath found in the Authours book, is the mention which he made of the <hi>determinations of Nationall Synods</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power exerciſed by the Claſſis, and the conſent of <hi>all Reformed Churches.</hi> Hereunto he anſwers, I. <hi>Councils may erre, &amp;c.</hi> II. <hi>Theſe teſtimonies are all humaine, &amp;c.</hi> III. <hi>This reaſon is the ſame which the Papiſts uſe, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. I. The Decrees of Synods were not alledged to proove the lawfulnes of this government, but to ſhew the eſtabliſhed exerciſe of it before the Author either knew the Claſſis or they him, &amp; that therefore he hath not ſubjected the Church to this power. II. Though Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils may erre, yet it doth not therfore follow that they do alwayes erre &amp; that they may not make decrees for the deciding of controverſies, as <hi>Vedelius</hi>
               <note n="(t)" place="margin">De Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. Armin. l. 2. c. 6. p. 183.184.</note> ſheweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arminians. III. Though the decrees of Synods have no abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet being framed according to the word of God, they doe ſpecially binde the Churches that are in combination with them: as when a Church-act or ſentence is made ſo as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. would have it, he will not deny but that the Congregation is bound to obſerve it. The other exceptions here added are already anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> IN the next place he undertakes to anſwer what was objected touching the long continuance of that which ſome of later times onely did complaine of. Here M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. brings in W.B. pretending ignorance of the former ſtate of that Cogrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet in ſuch termes as might hide the point in queſtion from the inconſiderate Reader. But not to ſpeak of what hath been frequently noted before, the colour
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:112189:148"/>given to this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which W.B. probably never dreamed of till it was ſuggeſted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. is when he makes him ſay, <hi>The thing ſpecially, which induced me ſo to thinke was his owne words, written to Mr Ainſworth; reporting how he was firſt made our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: hee ſaith,</hi>
               <note n="(v)" place="margin">Arrow ag. Separ. p. 116.</note> The Dutch Elderſhip in this City being deſired, both for their counſell &amp; help in his ordination; deputed three of their brethren to aſſiſt us in this buſineſſe, &amp;c. this they did not as aſſuming authoritie<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> to themſelves over us: but in our name, &amp; by our requeſt, &amp;c. <hi>If the Claſſis aſsumed not then any authority unto themſelves over us, how comes it to paſse that they doe it now? Or how will it hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that their power is ancient; and yet</hi> 20 <hi>or</hi> 30 <hi>yeares paſt, they uſed it not. This to me ſeemes groſſe contradiction, &amp;c.</hi> REPL. This his conceit of a groſſe contradiction, which he is ſo taken with that he ſpends almoſt a whole page of his Rhetorick upon it, is no better then a groſſe miſtake of his owne, which he hath blindely runne into by not diſcerning betwixt things that differ. 1. He confounds theſe two things as if they were one &amp; the ſame, viz. the <hi>Dutch Elderſhip</hi> of that city, &amp; the <hi>Claſſis;</hi> which being two diſtinct aſſemblies, there can be no contradiction in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that of the one which is denyed of the other. The Dutch Elderſhip is not the Claſſis, no more then the Engliſh Elderſhip of the ſame city. They are both members of the Claſſis, together with other Congregations of the neighbour townes &amp; villages. Now the Elderſhips of particular Churches are not ſubject one to another, neither doth one exerciſe authority over another, as hath been ſhewed<note n="(x)" place="margin">Pag. 29, 30, &amp; 159.</note> before. It is the Claſſis, or combination of more Churches or Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, ſending their Deputies thither, to whom is aſſcribed the power of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matters of particular Congregations. And this is ſo evident that if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. had but conſulted hereabout with W. B. in whoſe name he pleades on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he might have been ſufficiently informed of this trueth. Yea he might eaſily have learnt it out of the Authours former book, where he ſaith of the ſame Dutch Conſiſtory,<note n="(y)" place="margin">Anſw. to W. B. p. 70, 71.</note> 
               <hi>Though they had no power to judge &amp; determine the matter by their ſentence, yet they refuſed not to give their counſell &amp;c.</hi> 11. Though it had been ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, which was ſayd of the Dutch Conſiſtory, yet there had been no contradiction in the Authors words, ſaying that <hi>they aſſumed no authority to themſelves over them in his Ordination,</hi> &amp; yet avouching that the power which they exerciſed of later times, is the ſame which they had &amp; practiſed long before, for 1. The power which the Claſſis exerciſeth, is not by them <hi>aſsumed,</hi> but given unto them &amp; acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be their due by the Congregations that either at firſt or afterwards enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this confederacy for the ſubmitting of themſelves unto ſuch an aſſembly in all requiſite caſes. 2. The orders according to which the Claſſes doe here exerciſe their authority,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Kercke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Orden. Nat. Syn. Dordr. Art. 4.</note> doe not in ordinary caſes require the manifeſtation thereof in the Ordination of Miniſters; which being onely<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ameſ. Medul. l. 1. c. 39. th. 34.</note> 
               <hi>the ſolemne introduction of the Miniſter already choſen into the free exerciſe of his function,</hi> the Claſſis doth leave it to the Congregation itſelf, after they have conſented to the choyce of the Miniſter. 3. When a Congregation deſtitute of fit men for the ſolemniſing of an Ordination doth ſeek unto a neighbour Claſſis, Conſiſtory, or Miniſter, for their counſel &amp; help herein; they that in ſuch caſes doe yeeld unto their deſire, doe not exerciſe authority over that Congregation where the Miniſter is ordained: ſeeing they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:112189:148"/>performe that work in the name &amp; at the requeſt of the ſayd Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever power &amp; authoritie is therein exerciſed by a neighbour Miniſter, is not by him <hi>aſſumed,</hi> but <hi>received from the deſire of thoſe that ſeek his help,</hi> for the performance of this ſervice unto them in a time of need, as the Authour had before explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf in the<note n="(b)" place="margin">Arrow ag. Separ. p. 111, 112.114.</note> ſame book. And therefore he hath herein no way contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf, neither can this excuſe W.B. from that which was objected unto him.</p>
            <p>But by the concluſion of this plea it ſeemes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. did not ſo much intend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the defence of his client, as the caſting of ſome diſgrace upon the Authours book, called <hi>An Arrow againſt the Separation of the Browniſts,</hi> which he loves to have a fling at upon all occaſions: but his beating of the aire is apparent to thoſe that obſerve his blowes, &amp; mark where they light. From what is now ſaid it is manifeſt how vainely he hath here applyed againſt the ſaid book, what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had ſayd touching <hi>Mr Robinſons Iuſtification of Separation,</hi> viz. that it was <hi>ſick of King Iehorams incurable diſeaſe, &amp;c.</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. himſelf hath<note n="(c)" place="margin">Stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. p. 142.</note> elſwhere in his wonted language, acknowledged to be true. But to haſten to an end, &amp; to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſomewhat unto this cenſorious &amp; the forementioned ſlanderous concluſion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. that the Reader may partly underſtand what entertainment that <hi>Arrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Separation</hi> hath had among the godly learned, &amp; what they have judged of the Authors paines therein; I have here ſet downe the teſtimony of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſervant of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bunb.

Which if I might not ſpeake as truely, as freely; or did not thinke as unfainedly, as I write it willingly, I ſhould feare this might ſavour of ſome ſpice of flattery, which I have, &amp; (I know) you neither love, nor looke for at my hand.</hi> The ſubſtance of this his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious &amp; unpartiall approbation, hath been confirmed by ſundry others, in like manner eminent for learning &amp; piety, &amp; ſhall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les be further verifyed hereafter, according to His gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, who hath ſayd,<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 10.7.
